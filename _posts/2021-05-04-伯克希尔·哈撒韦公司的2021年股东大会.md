## 2021年股东信

伯克希尔哈撒韦公司致股东：

　　根据美国公认会计准则（GAAP），伯克希尔2020年的盈利为425亿美元。这一数字的四个组成部分是219亿美元的营业利润，49亿美元的实现资本利得，我们持有的股票中存在的净未实现资本利得增加所带来的267亿美元收益，最后，我们拥有的一些子公司和附属公司的价值减记导致的110亿美元损失。所有项目均在税后基础上列示。

　　营业利润是最重要的，即使它们不是我们公认会计准则总额中最大的项目。我们在伯克希尔的重点是增加我们的这部分收入和收购大的处于有利位置的企业。但去年，我们两个目标都没有实现：伯克希尔没有进行大规模收购，营业利润下降了9%。不过，通过保留收益和回购约5%的股票，我们确实提高了伯克希尔的每股内在价值。

　　与资本利得或损失（无论是已实现或未实现）相关的两个公认会计准则组成部分每年都在反复波动，这反映了股票市场的波动。无论今天的数据如何，我和我的长期合作伙伴查理·芒格都坚信，随着时间的推移，伯克希尔的投资收益将是可观的。

　　正如我多次强调的那样，查理和我将伯克希尔持有的上市股票（截至去年年底价值2810亿美元）视为一个企业集合。我们并不控制这些公司的运营，但我们确实按比例分享了它们的长期繁荣。然而，从会计角度来看，我们的那部分利润并没有包括在伯克希尔的收益中。相反，只有这些被投资方支付给我们的股息才会被记录在我们的账簿上。根据公认会计准则，被投资方代表我们保留的巨额资金也变成无形资产。

　　然而，这些看不见的东西不应该被忽视：这些未记录的留存收益通常为伯克希尔创造价值 —— 大量价值。被投资方利用这些留存资金来扩大业务、进行收购、偿还债务，通常还会回购股票（这种行为增加了我们在他们未来收益中所占的份额）。

　　正如我们在去年的股东信中指出的那样，留存收益在整个美国历史上推动了美国企业的发展。对卡内基和洛克菲勒行之有效的方法多年来对数百万股东也行之有效。

　　当然，我们的一些投资人会令人失望，他们留存的收益几乎没有增加他们公司的价值。但其他公司会超额完成任务，其中少数公司表现出色。总而言之，我们预计自己在伯克希尔非控股业务（别人会认为是我们的股票投资组合）留存的巨额收益中所占的份额，最终会给我们带来等量或更多的资本利得。在我们56年的任期中，这一期望一直得到满足。

　　我们GAAP数据的最后一个组成部分——丑陋的110亿美元减记——几乎是全部量化我在2016年犯的一个错误。那一年，伯克希尔收购了精密铸件公司（Precision Castparts，“PCC”），我付了太多的钱。

　　没有人以任何方式误导我——我只是对PCC的正常盈利潜力过于乐观。去年，作为PCC最重要的客户来源，整个航空航天业的不利发展，暴露了我的误判。

　　在收购PCC的过程中，伯克希尔收购了一家很好的公司，同行业中最好的一家。PCC的首席执行官马克-多尼根是一位充满激情的经理，他一如既往地将同样的精力投入到我们收购的业务中。我们很幸运有他来管理。

　　我认为我的结论是正确的，PCC将随着时间的推移，在其运营中部署的净有形资产上获得良好的回报。然而，我对未来收益的判断是错误的，因此，我也就错误地计算出了为收购该企业支付的合理价格。

　　PCC远非我犯下的第一个错误。但这是一个大错误。

　　**我们的弓上有两根弦**

　　伯克希尔哈撒韦经常被贴上“综合企业集团”的标签，这是一个贬义词，指的是拥有大量不相关业务的控股公司。是的，这是对伯克希尔正确的描述——但只是部分描画。为了更好理解我们如何以及为什么不同于其他综合性企业集团，让我们回顾一下历史。

　　长期以来，综合企业集团通常会局限于收购整个企业。然而，这一战略带来了两个大问题。有一个问题是无解的：大多数真正伟大的企业都无意让别人接管。因此，渴望收购的企业集团不得不专注于那些缺乏重要和持久竞争优势的一般公司。那不是一个钓鱼的好池塘。

　　除此之外，当联合企业不得不收购平庸的公司时，他们常常发现自己需要支付惊人的“控制权”溢价，以诱捕他们的猎物。一些精明的企业集团知道如何解决这个“超额支付”的问题：他们只需让自己公司估值变得高得离谱，来作为昂贵收购的“货币”。（“我愿意花1万美元买你的狗，做法是把我单价5000美元的两只猫给你。”）

　　通常，让综合企业集团股票估值过高的手段包括促销和“富有想象力的”会计操作，这些手段充其量是欺骗性的，有时甚至会越界成为欺诈。当这些招数“成功”时，这家集团会将自己的股价推至商业价值的三倍，以便收购估值是实际价值两倍的目标公司。

　　投资幻想可以持续相当长的时间。华尔街喜欢并购交易产生的费用，而媒体则喜欢精彩的推介者提供的故事。同样，有时候，一只被推销的股票飙升的价格本身也可以成为投资幻想就是现实的“证据”。

　　最终，当然，盛宴结束，许多商业“皇帝”没穿衣服。金融历史上充斥着许多著名企业集团的名字，这些企业家最初被记者、分析师和投资银行家誉为商业天才，但后来却被抛进商业垃圾场。

　　大集团声名狼藉。

　　********************

　　芒格和我希望我们的企业集团拥有具有良好财务状况和优秀经理人的多元化企业集团的全部或部分，而伯克希尔是否控制这些业务对我们来说并不重要。

　　我花了好一会儿才明白过来。但是芒格，还有我在伯克希尔继承的纺织业务中苦苦挣扎的20年经验，最终说服了我，拥有一个很棒的企业的不控股股权，要比拥有控股100%的挣扎在边缘企业更有利可图，更愉快，更少工作量。

　　基于这些原因，我们的企业集团将继续由可控的和非可控的业务组成。芒格和我会根据一家公司持久的竞争优势，管理能力和特点，以及价格，将资金配置到我们认为最合理的地方。

　　如果这一战略不需要我们付出多少努力，那就更好了。与跳水比赛使用的计分系统不同，你在商业活动中不会因为有“难度”而得分。此外，正如罗纳德-里根告诫的那样：“据说努力工作不会导致死亡，但我要说为什么要冒这个险呢？”

　　家族的珠宝以及我们如何增加你的珠宝份额

　　在A-1页，我们列出了伯克希尔旗下的子公司，这些公司在去年年底雇佣了36万名员工。

　　您可以在本报告后面的10-K中阅读到更多关于这些控股公司的信息。我们主要的头寸集中在我们拥有少量股权，但不控股的公司，这些公司列在这封信的第7页。这部分也同样非常庞大和多样化。

　　然而，伯克希尔的大部分价值存在于四大业务，其中三大业务为我们的控股业务，我们仅持有第四大业务5.4%的股权。四大业务都是珠宝。

　　价值最大的是我们的财产/意外险业务，53年来一直是伯克希尔的核心业务。我们的保险家族在保险领域是独一无二的。它的负责人Ajit Jain在1986年加入了伯克希尔哈撒韦公司，他也是独一无二的。

　　总的来说，我们保险业务的运营资金远远超过其全球竞争对手。我们的财务实力，加上伯克希尔每年从其非保险业务中获得的巨额现金流，使我们的保险公司能安全地遵循以购买股票为主的投资策略，这对绝大多数保险公司来说是不可行的。那些保险公司，出于监管和信用评级的原因，必须以购买债券为主。

　　现在债券并不是好的投资标的。你能相信最近10年期美国国债的收益率是0.93%——比1981年9月的15.8%的收益率下降了94%吗？在某些重要的大国，如德国和日本，投资者从数万亿美元的主权债务中获得负回报。全球范围内的固定收益投资者——无论是养老基金、保险公司还是退休人员——都面临着暗淡的未来。

　　一些保险公司，以及其他债券投资者，可能会试图通过将购买转移到由不稳定的借款人支持的债券，来为目前可怜的回报提供动力。然而，高风险贷款并不是解决利率不足问题的办法。30年前，一度强大的储蓄和贷款行业毁了自己，部分原因是忽视了这条箴言。

　　伯克希尔现在拥有1380亿美元的保险“浮动”资金 —— 这些资金不属于我们，但我们可以配置，无论是配置债券、股票还是美国国库券等现金等价物。浮动资金与银行存款有一些相似之处：保险公司每天都有现金进进出出，但保险公司持有的现金总额变化很小。伯克希尔持有的巨额资产很可能会在未来许多年保持在目前的水平，而且从累计角度看对我们来说是没有成本的。当然，这个令人高兴的结果可能会改变 —— 但是，随着时间的推移，我会喜欢我们的胜算。

　　在我每年给你们的信中，我已经重复地 —— 有些人可能会说没完没了地 —— 解释了我们的保险业务。因此，今年我会请希望更多了解我们保险业务和“浮动资金”的新股东阅读2019年报告的相关部分，今年再次刊发在A-2页。重要的是您要了解我们从事保险业务所存在的风险和机会。

　　我们第二和第三大最有价值的资产是伯克希尔对以货运量计美国最大铁路公司BNSF的100%持股，以及我们对苹果公司5.4%的持股。排名第四的是我们持有91%的伯克希尔哈撒韦能源公司（BHE）。这是一个非常不同寻常的公用事业公司，在我们拥有它的21年里，它的年收入从1.22亿美元增长到了34亿美元。

　　关于BNSF和BHE在这封信后面我将做更多说明。然而，现在，我想把重点放在伯克希尔会定期使用的一种做法上，以提高你对它的“四大资产”以及伯克希尔拥有的许多其他资产的兴趣。

　　************

　　去年，我们花247亿美元回购了相当于80，998股伯克希尔哈撒韦A股的股票，对伯克希尔的资产扩张表现出了热情。这一行动使你们在伯克希尔旗下所有企业的持股比例增加了5.2%，而你们根本不需要动用你们的钱包。

　　按照查理和我长期以来推荐的标准，我们进行了这些回购，因为我们相信，它们既能持续提高持股人的每股内在价值，也能让伯克希尔拥有充足的资金来应对可能遇到的任何机会或问题。

　　我们绝不认为伯克希尔的股票应该以任何价格回购。我之所以强调这一点，是因为美国的CEO们有过这样一个尴尬的记录：在股价上涨时，他们投入更多公司资金用于回购，而不是股价下跌时。我们的做法恰恰相反。

　　伯克希尔对苹果的投资生动地说明了回购的力量。我们从2016年末开始购买苹果股票，到2018年7月初，我们持有的苹果股票（经拆股调整后）略多于10亿股。说到这里，我指的是伯克希尔总账户中持有的投资，而不包括随后被出售的非常少的、单独管理的苹果股票。当我们在2018年年中完成购买时，伯克希尔的一般账户持有苹果5.2%的股份。

　　我们的投资成本是360亿美元。从那以后，我们都享受了定期股息，平均每年约7.75亿美元，而且在2020年，通过出售我们头寸的一小部分，我们还获得了额外的110亿美元。

　　尽管有出售 —— 你们瞧！ —— 伯克希尔目前仍持有苹果5.4%的股份。这一增长对我们来说是没有成本的，因为苹果一直在回购其股票，从而大幅减少了目前的流通股票数量。

　　但这远不是所有的好消息。因为我们还在两年半内回购了伯克希尔的股票，你现在间接拥有的苹果资产和未来收益比2018年7月整整多10%。

　　这种令人愉快的动态仍在继续。伯克希尔自去年底以来回购了更多股票，并且将来可能会进一步减少其股票数量。苹果也公开表示有意回购其股票。随着流通股的减少，伯克希尔的股东不仅将在我们的保险集团、BNSF（北伯林顿铁路公司）和BHE（伯克希尔·哈撒韦能源公司）中拥有更大的利益，而且还会发现他们对苹果的间接所有权也在增加。

　　回购的数学看似缓慢，但随着时间的推移会产生强大的力量。该过程为投资者提供了一种简单的方式，让他们拥有不断扩大的企业份额。正如性感女星梅·韦斯特（Mae West）向我们保证的那样： “太多的好东西都可以是美好的”。

　　**投资**

　　下面我们列出了15笔年底市值最大的普通股投资。我们排除了卡夫亨氏的持股——325，442，152股——因为伯克希尔是一个控股集团的一部分，因此必须使用“权益”法来计算这笔投资。在伯克希尔的资产负债表上，卡夫亨氏持有的卡夫亨氏资产按公认会计准则计算为133亿美元，这一数字代表伯克希尔在2020年12月31日经审计的卡夫亨氏资产净值中所占的份额。但请注意，2020年12月31日我们这些股票的市值只有113亿美元。

　　**双城记**

　　在美国，成功的故事俯拾皆是。自我们国家诞生以来，那些有理想、有抱负，但往往只有微薄资本的人，通过创造新东西或用旧东西改善顾客体验，取得了超出他们梦想的成功。

　　查理和我曾游历全美，与这些人或他们的家人相遇。在西海岸，我们从1972年收购喜诗糖果（See’s Candy）开始了这一惯例。整整一个世纪前，玛丽·时思（Mary See）开始推出一种古老的产品，她用特殊的配方对其进行了改造。除了她的商业计划之外，她还开设了一些古色古香的商店，里面有友好的销售人员。她在洛杉矶开的第一家小专卖店最终发展成了几百家商店，遍布整个西部。

　　今天，时思女士的作品继续令客户感到愉悦，同时为成千上万的男女提供终身就业机会。伯克希尔的工作就是不干涉公司的成功。当企业生产和分销一种非必需的消费品时，客户就是老板。而且，100年后，客户向伯克希尔传递的信息依然清晰：“不要乱动我的糖果。（喜诗糖果的网址是 https：//www.sees.com/，可以试试他们的花生糖。）

　　接下来让我们跨越大陆来到华盛顿特区。1936年，利奥·古德温和他的妻子莉莲开始相信，汽车保险——一种通常从代理商那里购买的标准化产品——可以直接以低得多的价格出售。两人怀揣10万美元，与拥有1000倍甚至更多资本的大型保险公司展开了较量。政府雇员保险公司（后来简称为GEICO）由此开始了其漫漫征程。

　　幸运的是，我在整整70年前就了解到了这家公司的潜力。它立刻成为了我的初恋（在投资方面）。接下来的故事大家都知道了：伯克希尔最终100%拥有了GEICO，这家84岁年历史公司一直在微调，但没有改变利奥和莉莲的愿景。

　　当然，该公司的规模发生了变化。1937年，也就是GEICO运营的第一个整年，其完成了238，288美元的业务。去年的数字是350亿美元。

　　************

　　今天，沿海地区汇聚了大量金融、媒体、政府和科技机构，人们很容易忽视美国中部发生的很多奇迹。让我们关注两个社区，它们为我们全国各地的人才和雄心提供了令人惊叹的例证。

　　我从奥马哈开始，你们不会感到奇怪，

　　1940年，毕业于奥马哈中心高中（也是查理、我父亲、我第一任妻子、我们的三个孩子和两个孙儿的母校）的杰克·林格沃特（Jack Ringwalt）决定用12.5万美元的资本创办一家财产/意外伤害保险公司。

　　杰克的梦想似乎是荒谬的，因为这要求他的小公司——有点浮夸地被命名为国民保险公司（National Indemnity）——与大型保险公司竞争，而这些公司都拥有充足的资本。此外，这些竞争对手凭借遍布全国的、资金雄厚的、历史悠久的当地代理商网络而牢固地确立了自己的地位。

　　在杰克的计划中，与GEICO不同的是，国民保险公司本身会使用任何屈尊接受它的机构，因此在收购业务时没有成本优势。为了克服这些可怕的障碍，国民保险将重点放在了被大公司认为不重要的“古怪”风险上。不可思议的是，这一策略成功了。

　　杰克诚实、精明、讨人喜欢，还有点古怪。他尤其不喜欢监管机构。每当他对他们的监督感到厌烦时，他就会有卖掉公司的冲动。

　　幸运的是，有一次我就在附近。杰克想加入伯克希尔，于是我们在1967年达成了交易，只用了15分钟就达成了。我从没要求过审计。

　　今天，国民保险公司是世界上唯一一家愿意为某些巨大风险承保的公司。是的，它的总部仍然在奥马哈，距离伯克希尔的总部只有几英里。

　　多年来，我们又从奥马哈家族手中收购了四家企业，其中最著名的是内布拉斯加州家具市场（NFM）。该公司的创始人罗斯-布卢姆金（Rose Blumkin，B夫人）是俄罗斯移民，在1915年来到西雅图，她既不会读也不会说英语。几年后，她定居在奥马哈。在1936年，她攒下了2500美元，用这笔钱开了一家家具店。

　　竞争对手和供应商忽视了她，而他们的判断在当时无疑是正确的：第二次世界大战让她的生意停滞了。在1946年底，公司的净资产仅增长到72，264美元。现金，不论是在收银台里还是在存款里，总共是50美元（没有打错字）。

　　然而，有一笔无价的财富没有在1946年的数字中记录下来：B夫人唯一的儿子路易-布卢姆金（Louie Blumkin）在美国军队服役四年后重新加入了这家商店。在诺曼底登陆后，路易参加了诺曼底奥马哈海滩的战斗，并因在Bulge战役中受伤而获得了紫心勋章，最终在1945年11月乘船回国。

　　一旦B夫人和路易重聚，就没有什么能阻止这家家具店的发展了。在梦想的驱使下，母亲和儿子不分昼夜地工作。其结果是创造了零售业的一个奇迹。

　　到1983年，两人已经让家具店的业务规模达到了6000万美元。那一年，在我生日那天，伯克希尔收购了NFM 80%的股份。同样，我们没有对这家家具店进行审计。我指望布卢姆金的家族成员来经营企业。今天，NFM正由第三代和第四代布卢姆金的家族成员管理着。需要指出的是，B夫人每天都在工作，直到103岁——在查理和我看来，这是一个可笑的过早退休年龄。

　　NFM目前拥有美国最大的三家家居用品商店，尽管NFM的门店因新冠关闭了疫情六周多，但这三家商店在2020年都创下了销售记录。

　　这个故事的后记说明了一切：每当B夫人的一大家子人聚在一起过节吃饭时，她总是要求他们在吃饭前唱首歌。她的选择从未改变过：欧文-柏林（Irving Berlin）的《上帝保佑美国》（God Bless America）。

　　************

　　让我们向东转移到田纳西州的第三大城市诺克斯维尔。在那里，伯克希尔拥有两家引人注目的公司——克莱顿住宅（Clayton Homes）（100%持股）和Pilot Travel Centers（目前持股38%，但到2023年将达到80%）。

　　每一家公司都是由一位毕业于田纳西大学并留在诺克斯维尔的年轻人创立的。这两个年轻人都没有足够的资金，父母也不富裕。

　　但是，那又怎样？如今，克莱顿和Pilot的每人的年税前利润都超过了10亿美元。这两家公司共雇用了大约4.7万名男女员工。

　　吉姆-克莱顿（Jim Clayton）在经历了几次商业冒险之后，于1956年以小本经营的方式创建了克莱顿住宅（Clayton Homes）。1958年，“大个子吉姆”（Big Jim Haslam）以6000美元的价格购买了一个服务站，创建了后来的Pilot Travel Centers。后来，他俩的儿子也都加入了他们的父亲的公司，他们的儿子有着和他们父亲一样的激情、价值观和头脑。有时候基因太有魔力了。

　　现年90岁的“大吉姆”Haslam最近写了一本鼓舞人心的书，他在书中讲述了Jim Clayton的儿子Kevin是如何鼓励Haslam家族将大部分的Pilot Travel Centers卖给伯克希尔的。每个零售商都知道满意的顾客是商店的最佳销售人员。当企业易手时也是如此。

　　************

　　当您下次飞越诺克斯维尔或奥马哈时，向*Clayton*家族、Haslam家族和Blumkin家族，以及遍布全国各地的成功企业家们脱帽致敬吧。这些创造者需要美国的繁荣框架（它始于1789年进行的一次独特实验）才能发挥潜力。反过来，美国需要像这些杰出的公民来实现我们开国元勋所追求的奇迹。

　　如今，许多人在世界各地创造了类似的奇迹，创造了使全人类受益的繁荣。然而，在其短暂的232年中，还没有其他像美国这样可以释放人类潜能的孵化器。尽管出现了严重的中断，但我国的经济发展却令人叹为观止。

　　除此之外，我们保留着成为“更完美联盟”的宪政愿望。在这方面的进展缓慢，不平衡且经常令人沮丧。但是，我们已经向前迈进，并将继续前进。

　　我们坚定的结论：绝不与美国作对赌。

　　**伯克希尔的伙伴关系**

　　伯克希尔是特拉华州的一家公司，我们的董事必须遵守该州的法律。其中包括要求董事会成员必须为公司及其股东的最佳利益行事。我们的董事们拥护这一原则。

　　此外，伯克希尔公司的董事当然希望公司能取悦客户，发展和奖励其36万名员工的才能，与放贷人的往来光明正大，并在许多我们运营业务的城市和州被视为良好公民。我们重视这四个重要的群体。

　　但这些团体中，没有任何一个团体在确定诸如股息、战略方向，首席执行官人选、并购和资产剥离之类的事情上有投票权。这些方面的责任完全是伯克希尔公司董事们的责任，他们必须忠实地代表公司及其所有者的长期利益。

　　除了法律要求之外，查理和我还对伯克希尔的许多个人股东负有一种特殊的义务。一些个人经历可能会帮助您了解我们不寻常的关系，以及它何影响我们的行为。

　　************

　　在我执掌伯克希尔之前，我通过一系列合伙企业为许多个人管理资金，其中最早的3家合伙企业成立于1956年。随着时间的流逝，同时运营多个实体变得难以控制，在1962年，我们将12个合伙企业合并为一个独立的实体，即巴菲特合伙有限公司（Buffett Partnership Ltd．“ BPL”）。

　　到那一年，几乎所有我自己的钱，以及我妻子所有的钱，都一起投入了我的许多有限合伙公司的基金。我没有薪水，也没有费用收入。相反，作为普通合伙人，我的有限合伙公司只有在他们获得的年度回报率高于6%的门槛之后，才会给我报酬。如果收益未能达到该水平，差额部分就从我未来的应得利润中扣除。（幸运的是，从未发生过这种事：合伙人回报率总是超过6%的“标准杆”。）随着岁月的流逝，我父母、兄弟姐妹、姨妈姑婶、叔叔舅舅、表兄弟和姻亲都将大部分资金投资给了上述合伙企业。

　　查理在1962年成立了合伙公司，运作方式和我差不多。我们都没有任何机构投资者，我们的合作伙伴中也很少有金融行家。那些加入我们公司的人相信我们会像对待自己的钱一样对待他们的钱。这些人——要么凭直觉，要么依靠朋友们的建议——正确地得出了这样的结论：查理和我对资本的永久亏损有着极端的厌恶，除非我们预期他们的钱会做得相当不错，否则我们不会接受他们的钱。

　　1965年BPL收购伯克希尔哈撒韦的控制权后，我无意中进入了企业管理领域。后来，在1969年，我们决定解散BPL。年底后，这家合伙企业按比例分配了所有现金和三支股票，其中价值最高的是BPL在伯克希尔哈撒韦的70.5%股权。

　　与此同时，查理在1977年结束了其公司的运营。在他分配给合伙人的资产中，有Blue Chip Stamps的主要股份，这是他的合伙人、伯克希尔和我共同控制的一家公司。Blue Chip也是我的合伙公司解散时分配的三支股票之一。

　　1983年，伯克希尔和Blue Chip合并，使伯克希尔的注册股东基础从1900人扩大到2900人。查理和我希望所有人——新老股东和潜在股东——都能步调一致达成共识。

　　因此，在1983年的年报中——首当其冲——列出了伯克希尔的“主要商业原则”。第一条原则这样开始：“虽然我们的形式是公司，但我们的态度是合作关系。”“这定义了我们在1983年的关系，这样是我们对今天的定义。查理和我——以及我们的董事们——相信这句格言在未来几十年里将对伯克希尔大有裨益。

　　************

　　伯克希尔的所有权现在分为五个大“桶”，其中一个由我作为“创始人”占据。那一桶肯定会空，因为我拥有的股票每年都会分配给各种慈善机构。

　　其余四桶中有两桶由机构投资者占据，各自负责管理他人的资金。然而，这就是这两个桶之间的不同之处：它们的投资程序截然不同。

　　一个机构类型是指数基金，这是投资界一个规模庞大、迅速发展的领域。这些基金只是紧跟它们追踪的指数。指数投资者最喜欢的是标普500指数（S&P 500），伯克希尔哈撒韦是该指数的成份股。应该强调的是，指数基金之所以持有伯克希尔的股票，只是因为它们被要求这么做。他们处于自动驾驶状态，买卖只是为了“权重”目的。

　　另一个机构类型则是管理客户资金的专业人士，不管这些资金属于富人、大学、退休人员或任何人。这些职业经理人的职责是根据他们对估值和前景的判断，将资金从一项投资转移到另一项投资。这是一个光荣而艰难的职业。

　　我们很高兴为这个“活跃的”团体工作，同时他们也在寻找更好的地方来配置客户资金。可以肯定的是，一些基金经理着眼长远，很少进行交易。还有一些人使用计算机，利用算法可以在一纳秒内指导股票的买卖。一些专业投资者会根据他们的宏观经济判断来回操作。

　　第四类是个人股东，他们的运作方式与我刚才描述的积极型机构经理人类似。可以理解的是，当这些股东看到另一项令他们兴奋的投资时，他们会把自己持有的伯克希尔股票视为可能的资金来源。我们对这种态度没有异议，这与我们看待我们在伯克希尔持有的一些股票的方式类似。

　　综上所述，如果查理和我对我们的第五桶没有特别的亲缘感，那我们就没有人性了。第五桶就是超过百万的个人投资者，他们相信我们会代表他们的利益，不管未来会发生什么。他们加入我们并不打算离开，他们的心态与我们最初的合作伙伴相似。事实上，在我们合伙期间的许多投资者，以及/或他们的后代，仍然是伯克希尔的主要所有者。

　　斯坦·特鲁尔森（Stan Truhlsen）就是这些老合作伙伴中的一个典型代表，他是奥马哈市一位开朗慷慨的眼科医生，也是一位私人朋友，他在2020年11月13日迎来了自己的100岁生日。1959年，斯坦和其他10名年轻的奥马哈医生与我结成了伙伴关系。他们创造性地将自己的公司命名为Emdee， Ltd。每年，他们都会和我和妻子一起在家里举行庆祝晚餐。

　　当我们的合伙人在1969年分配伯克希尔股票时，所有的医生都保留了他们得到的股票。他们可能不知道投资或会计的来龙去脉，但他们知道在伯克希尔他们将被视为合伙人。

　　斯坦的两名来自Emdee的朋友现龄都90多岁了，他们仍然持有伯克希尔的股票。这一群体惊人的持久性——加上查理和我分别是97岁和90岁的事实——提出了一个有趣的问题：持有伯克希尔的股票会让人长寿吗？

　　* * * * * * * * * * * *

　　伯克希尔不同寻常且备受重视的个人股东家族，可能会让你更加理解我们不愿讨好华尔街分析师和机构投资者。我们已经有了我们想要的投资者，总的来说，我们不认为他们会被通过替代品来升级。

　　可供伯克希尔拥有的席位有限，也就是流通股。我们非常喜欢已经拥有了它们的人。

　　当然，“合伙人”也会发生一些变动。不过，查理和我希望这种变动很微小。毕竟，谁会寻求朋友、邻居或婚姻的快速转变呢？

　　1958年，菲尔·费舍尔写了一本关于投资的极好的书。在这篇文章中，他将经营一家上市公司比作经营一家餐厅。他说，如果你在寻找食客，无论是汉堡配可乐还是带有异国情调的葡萄酒配法国美食，你都可以吸引顾客并获得成功。但是，费雪警告说，你不能随意地从一个口味转换到另一个：你给潜在客户的信息必须与他们进入你的场所后发现的一致。

　　在伯克希尔，我们提供汉堡和可乐已经56年了。我们珍惜这一票价所吸引的顾客。

　　美国和其他地方的数千万其他投资者和投机者有各种各样的股票选择，以符合他们的口味。他们将会找到拥有诱人想法的首席执行官和市场专家。如果他们想要价格目标，管理收益和“故事”，他们不会缺少追求者。“技术人员”将充满信心地指导他们，告诉他们图表上的一些波动预示着股票的下一步走势。要求采取行动的呼声永远不会停止。

　　我要补充的是，这些投资者中的许多人会做得很好。毕竟，持有股票在很大程度上是一个“正和”博弈。事实上，一个耐心且头脑冷静的猴子，通过向标普500的上市公司投掷50支飞镖构建的投资组合，随着时间的推移，只要它不受诱惑改变原来的“选择”，它就将会享受股息和资本收益。

　　生产性资产，如农场、房地产，当然还有企业所有权，都能产生财富——大量的财富。大多数拥有这些资产的人都会得到回报。所需要的只是时间的流逝、内心的平和、充足的多元化以及交易和费用的最小化。不过，投资者决不能忘记，他们的支出就是华尔街的收入。而且，和我的猴子不一样，华尔街的人可不是为了花生而工作的。

　　当伯克希尔有空位时——我们希望这样的空位很少——我们希望它们能被那些了解并渴望我们所提供的东西的新来者所占据。经过几十年的管理，查理和我仍然不能承诺结果。然而，我们可以并确实保证将你们视为合作伙伴。

　　我们的后继者也会如此。

　　**伯克希尔的一个可能令你吃惊的数字**

　　最近，我了解到一个我从未怀疑过的关于我们公司的事实：伯克希尔拥有的位于美国的房地产、工厂和设备——这类资产构成了我们国家的“商业基础设施”——它们的公认会计准则估值超过了任何其他美国公司所拥有的数量。伯克希尔的这些国内“固定资产”的折旧成本为1540亿美元。紧随其后的是AT&T，其拥有的房地产、厂房和设备价值1270亿美元。

　　我应该补充一点，我们在固定资产所有权方面的领导地位，其本身并不意味着投资的胜利。最好的结果出现在那些只需要很少资产就能开展高利润业务的公司，以及那些提供只需要很少额外资本就能扩大销售额的产品或服务的公司。事实上，我们拥有一些这样的杰出企业，但他们相对较小，发展也比较缓慢。

　　然而，重资产的公司可以是很好的投资。事实上，我们很高兴看到我们的两大巨头——BNSF和BHE。2011年，也就是伯克希尔拥有BNSF的第一个整年，这两家公司的利润合计为42亿美元。2020年，对很多企业来说都是艰难的一年，但这两家公司却赚了83亿美元。

　　BNSF和BHE在未来几十年将需要大量的资本支出。好消息是，两者都可能带来适当的增量投资回报。

　　让我们先看看BNSF。它的铁路运输了美国境内所有非本地货物（按吨英里计算）的15%，无论是通过铁路、卡车、管道、驳船还是飞机。BNSF的负载远远超过任何其他承运人。

　　美国铁路的历史很有趣。在经历了150年左右的疯狂建设、欺诈、过度建设、破产、重组和合并之后，铁路行业终于在几十年前成熟并合理化了。

　　BNSF于1850年开始运营，在伊利诺伊州东北部修建了一条12英里长的线路。如今，BNSF有390个前身，他们的铁路被收购或合并。这家公司广泛的血统分布可以参看http://www.bnsf.com/bnsf-resources/pdf/about-bnsf/History_and_Legacy.pdf．

　　伯克希尔在2010年初收购了BNSF。自从被我们收购以来，这家铁路公司在固定资产上投资了410亿美元，超过了折旧费用200亿美元。铁路是一项户外运动，火车必须在极冷和极热的环境下可靠地行驶，因为它们总是会遇到从沙漠到山脉的各种地形。大规模洪水周期性发生。BNSF拥有23000英里的铁路，遍布28个州，必须不惜一切代价在其庞大的系统中最大限度地提高安全性和服务。

　　尽管如此，BNSF（北伯林顿铁路公司）还是向伯克希尔支付了大量股息——总计418亿美元。然而，铁路公司只会在满足其业务需求和保持20亿美元现金余额后，再付给我们剩下的钱。这种保守的政策允许BNSF以较低的利率借款，而不依赖伯克希尔对其债务的任何担保。

　　关于BNSF的另一个点是：去年，该公司首席执行官卡尔·艾尔（Carl Ice）和他的二号人物凯蒂•法默（Katie Farmer）在控制开支方面做了出色的工作，同时克服了业务的严重低迷。尽管载货量下降了7%，但这两位实际上使BNSF的利润率提高了2.9个百分点。卡尔如计划的那样，在年底退休了，凯蒂接任了首席执行官一职。因此，BNSF的管理依然优秀。

　　与BNSF不同的是，BHE（伯克希尔·哈撒韦能源公司）不支付普通股股息，这在电力行业很不常见。我们拥有该公司21年了，这种斯巴达式的政策贯穿了整个时期。与铁路不同，我们国家的电力设施需要大规模的改造，最终的成本是惊人的。这一努力将在未来几十年吸收BHE的全部收入。我们欢迎挑战，相信增加的投资将得到适当的回报。

　　让我来告诉你BHE的一项努力——它承诺投入180亿美元，对已经过时的电网进行改造和扩建，这些电网现在正在向整个西部输送电力。BHE在2006年开始这个项目，预计在2030年完成——是的，2030年。

　　可再生能源的出现使我们的项目成为社会的必需品。从历史上看，长期以来盛行的燃煤发电都位于人口密集的地区。然而，新世界风能和太阳能发电的最佳地点往往是在偏远地区。当BHE在2006年评估情况时，对西部输电线路进行巨额投资已不是什么秘密。然而，在计算项目成本后，当时很少有公司或政府机构有财力接手。

　　应该指出的是，BHE的决定是基于它对美国政治、经济和司法体系的信任。要获得可观的收入，需要投入数十亿美元。输电线路必须跨越各州和其他司法管辖区的边界，每个州都有自己的规则和选区。BHE还需要与数百名土地所有者打交道，并与生产可再生能源的供应商和向客户输送电力的遥远的公用事业公司签订复杂的合同。竞争激烈的利益集团和旧秩序的捍卫者，以及渴望立即出现一个新世界的不切实际的梦想家，都必须加入进来。

　　惊喜和延迟都是肯定的。然而，同样可以肯定的是，BHE具备管理才能、机构承诺和财力来履行其承诺。虽然我们的西部输电项目要多年才能完成，但我们今天正在寻找其他类似规模的项目来承担。

　　无论遇到何种障碍，BHE都将成为提供更清洁能源的领导者。

　　**年度会议**

　　去年2月22日，我写信告诉你，我们计划召开一个盛大的年会。不到一个月，这个计划就被废弃了。

　　由梅丽莎·夏皮罗（Melissa Shapiro）和伯克希尔首席财务官马克·汉伯格（Marc Hamburg）领导的总部小组迅速重组。他们的即兴表演奇迹般地奏效了。伯克希尔副董事长之一格雷格·阿贝尔（Greg Abel）和我一起上台，面对着一个黑暗的舞台、1.8万个空座位和一台摄像机。没有彩排：我和格雷格在“表演时间”开始前45分钟到达。

　　我令人难以置信的助手Debbie Bosanek于47年前加入伯克希尔，当时她年仅17岁，她整理了约25张幻灯片，这些幻灯片展示了我在家中整理的各种事实和人物。幻灯片由一个匿名但非常能干的计算机和摄像头操作团队以适当的顺序投影到屏幕上。

　　雅虎将整个过程向创纪录的国际听众直播。CNBC的Becky Quick在新泽西州的家中工作，在Greg和我上台的四个小时内，从观众通过她的电子邮箱提交的成千上万个问题中挑选出问题。See’s花生脆和软糖，以及可口可乐，为我们提供食品。

　　今年，5月1日，我们计划举办一次更好的活动。同样，我们将依靠Yahoo和CNBC完美无缺的表现。雅虎将于美国东部时间下午1点开始直播。直播网址请登录 https：//finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream

　　我们的正式董事会议将于美东时间下午5：00开始，应在下午5：30结束。在此之前，在1：30-5：00之间，我们将回答Becky Quick转交的问题。和往常一样，我们不知道问题是什么。将您有趣的话发送到BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com。雅虎直播将在5：30之后结束。

　　现在——此处应有掌声——惊喜来了。今年，我们的会议将在洛杉矶举行……而查理将会上台，在整个3个半小时的问答环节中回答问题并发表意见。去年（他没来）我想念他，更重要的是，你们显然也想念他。我们宝贵的副主席Ajit Jain和Greg Abel也将与我们一起回答有关其业务领域的问题。

　　欢迎通过*Yahoo*观看我们的会议。将您真正棘手的问题转给查理！我们会很开心的，希望您也一样。

　　当然，更好的是我们面对面相见的那一天，我希望并期待能在2022年相见。奥马哈市民、我们的参展子公司以及我们所有在总部工作的人，都迫不及待地希望您参加真正的伯克希尔式大会。

　　2021年2月27日

以下为巴菲特2020年致股东公开信全文翻译：

伯克希尔哈撒韦的各位股东：

伯克希尔2019财年基于通用会计准则（GAAP）的盈利为814亿美元。具体而言，这一总数当中包含240亿美元运营盈利，以及我们所持有股票产生的37亿美元已兑现资本利得和537亿美元的未兑现资本利得。前列所有均为税后数据。

关于这537亿美元利得，必须做一个补充说明。根据2018年生效的新版通用会计准则，一家企业所持有的证券，即便是尚未兑现的利得和亏损净变化也必须计入盈利数据。正如我们在去年股东信当中所澄清的，无论是我，还是和我一起管理伯克希尔的伙伴查理·芒格（Charlie Munger），我们对这种新规其实都持保留态度。

这种新规会被推出和采用，本质上说来，其实是标志着会计专业理念的一次重大改变。

2018年之前，通用会计准则坚持认为，除非一家企业的生意就是证券交易本身，不然的话，投资组合当中未兑现的资本利得任何时候都不该被计入盈利，而未兑现的亏损也只有在被认为是“非暂时性”的情况下才可以计入。现在，根据新规，伯克希尔必须将这些数据计入每个季度的盈利之中，不管这些证券的涨涨跌跌不管有多么起伏不定，可能会造成怎样的影响——对于众多投资者、分析师和评论家来说，这也成了他们必须掌握的新知识。

伯克希尔2018年和2019年的具体数据其实正清楚地证明了我们对新规的判断的正当性。正如我们发布的数据所显示的，2018年是股市遭遇不顺的一年，我们未兑现的利得缩减了206亿美元之多，于是我们当年度的通用会计准则盈利就只剩下了40亿美元。至于2019年，如前所述，由于股票价格的上涨，我们未兑现的利得猛增了537亿美元，使得通用会计准则盈利达到了前面所报告的814亿美元。换言之，股市行情的变化使得我们的通用会计准则盈利猛增了令人瞠目结舌的1900%！

然而，与会计世界不同的是，在我们认为的现实世界当中，伯克希尔所持有的股票总规模这两年一直保持在大约2000亿美元的水平，这些股票的内在价值也基本上都是在稳步而坚实地增长。

查理和我呼吁大家专注于运营盈利——我们的这一数据2019年较之前一年基本没有大的变化——同时不要去在意投资的季度或年度的利得或亏损，不管是已经兑现的还是尚未兑现的。

我们的这种建议绝不是忽视或贬低伯克希尔这些投资的价值。查理和我都预计，我们的股票投资，虽然其一时间表现出的具体形态可能难以预测，高度不规律，但是长期角度而言，注定会为我们创造巨大的利得。我们为何会如此乐观？下面的章节将会展开讨论。

保留盈利的力量

1924年，一位名声并不是那么显赫的经济学家、理财顾问埃德加·劳伦斯 ·史密斯（Edgar Lawrence Smith）完成了一本《普通股的长期投资》（CommonStocks as Long Term Investments），这虽然只是一本薄薄的册子，但是却改变了整个投资世界的面貌。事实上，撰写这本书的经历也改变了史密斯本人，迫使他开始重新评估自己的投资信条。

刚开始写作的时候，他最初想要说明的观点是，在通货膨胀周期当中，股票的表现要好于债券，而在通货紧缩周期当中，债券的回报则好过股票。看上去，这样的观点是合情合理的。可是接下来，史密斯自己都吃了一惊。

事实上，在这本书的最开头，史密斯就承认：“这些研究本身就是对失败的记录——事实并不能支持预设的观点。”然而，这却是投资者的幸事，因为失败迫使史密斯更加深入地思考，去探索到底该如何评估股票的价值。

要把握住史密斯到底洞见了些什么，我想最好还是引述一段关于他著作的最早期评论，来自约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）：“我一直读完全书，才大致搞清楚了史密斯先生最新奇的，当然也是最重要的观点到底是什么。

那些真正优秀的工业企业管理层是不会将他们每年所获的利润都全部派发给股东的，这是一个基本原则。

哪怕不是所有年景，至少在好的年景下，这些企业都会留下一部分利润，将其重新投入到其业务本身。这样就创造出一种有利于可靠的工业投资的复利运营模式。经年累月，这笔可靠的工业财富的真实价值就会以复利速度增长，更不必说股东们还得到了源源不断的股息。”

得到了这位经济学大家的加持，史密斯一夜成名。

在史密斯的这本著作出版之前，保留盈利的做法居然会让股东们都感到不满，这样的逻辑，今人已经很难理解了。毕竟，我们现在都知道，当年的卡耐基、洛克菲勒和福特等大家族之所以能够积累起令人瞠目结舌的巨大财富，靠的就是保留住很大一部分企业盈利，将其投入未来的成长，创造出更大的利润。事实上，不光是这些巨头们，在全美的范围内，真不知有多少具体而微的资本家们是靠着重复同样的剧本而发家致富的。

然而，事实就是，在史密斯之前的年代当中，当企业所有权被分割成无数小片——“股票”，后者的购买者们通常都将自己的投资视作是针对市场行情变动的短期赌博，往最好听里说也不过就是投机而已——真正的绅士们青睐的是债券。

不管投资者们变聪明的速度有多么迟缓，到今天，保留盈利用于再投资的数学公式都已经被大家充分理解了。曾经被凯恩斯评为“新奇”的观念，对于现在的高中生都已经是常识了——将储蓄和复利结合，就可以创造奇迹。

在伯克希尔，查理和我一直以来都高度重视有效地运用保留盈利。有些时候，这份工作其实是很轻松的，可是在另外一些时候，这份工作用“困难”来形容都嫌不足——尤其是我们面对着体量巨大，而且还在持续膨胀的现金的时候。

我们想要将自己所保留的这些资金投入使用，首选的目标就是投资于我们业已拥有的数量众多、种类繁杂的生意当中。单单在过去十年时间里，伯克希尔的折旧支出就累计达到650亿美元，而内部的地皮、厂房和设备投资累计更达到1210亿美元。再投资于运营资产永远都是我们的优先考虑对象。

此外，我们还在持续寻求买进新的企业的机会，只要后者能够符合三个标准。首先，他们运营的净有形资本必须能够创造得体的回报。其次，经理人必须是德才兼备，既有能力又诚实。最后，买进价格必须合理。

一旦我们找到了这样的企业，只要条件允许，我们都会希望将其100%全部收购下来。遗憾的是，符合我们前面全部要求的大规模收购机会其实颇为稀有。在更多的时候，我们还是只能去把握住股市波动当中涌现出的机会，去收购那些符合标准的上市公司的大量股份，但是往往并不能达到控股的程度。

无论我们到底是如何进行的投资——是控股了这些企业，还是只通过市场购入了一大笔股权——伯克希尔的财务表现很大程度上都将取决于我们所投资的这些企业的未来盈利能力。只不过，投资者必须明白，这两种投资方式在会计层面是存在着巨大差异的。

那些我们控股的企业（具体定义为伯克希尔持有50%以上股权），他们各自的盈利都会直接计入我们报告的运营盈利数据。各位看到的就是实实在在的盈利。

至于那些非控股企业，即我们拥有相当数量股票的企业，只有他们的股息才会被计入伯克希尔报告的运营盈利数据。当然，他们也会有自己的保留盈利，用来投入运转、创造更多附加值，但是这一切都不会从伯克希尔发布的盈利数据当中直接体现出来。

在几乎所有其他的大企业财报当中，投资者都不会看到伯克希尔这种高度重视和列出“未实现盈利”的做法。可是，对于我们而言，这却是一项非常重大，不容忽略的内容，必须详细列出如下。

以下，我们将列出我们通过股市投资的10支最重要成份股。

![img](https://n.sinaimg.cn/translate/543/w1398h745/20200223/5f34-ipvnszf0985164.jpg)

显然，这些我们只是部分拥有的企业，我们最终能够记录下来的已兑现利得是不会与他们保留盈利当中根据“我们”持股比例计算出的结果准确对应的。虽然遗憾，但是也不能不承认，有些时候，保留盈利也可能会无功而返。只不过，不管是根据逻辑常识，还是根据我们过往的经验，我们都更加倾向于相信，这些企业和股票最终将实现的资本利得至少会与他们保留盈利当中属于我们的份额相当，很可能还会犹有过之。（需要补充的是，当我们最终卖掉这些股票，实现利得，我们必须按照当时的税率缴纳联邦所得税，目前的适用税率为21%。）

可以肯定地说，伯克希尔从这10家公司，以及我们做了股票投资的其他许多家公司所获取的回报未来还将以极不规则的形态持续呈现。有时可能是基于某家企业自身的问题，有时可能是因为股市大盘的缘故，亏损总会周期性发生。与此同时，在另外一些时间段当中，我们的利得则可能会爆炸式增长，比如去年就是个例子。整体而言，我们投资兑现的保留盈利对于伯克希尔自身价值的增长无疑是具有重大意义的。

史密斯完全正确。

非保险业务

汤姆·墨菲（Tom Murphy）是伯克希尔的重要董事，他是史上伟大的企业经理人之一。很早之前，他就给过我一些有关收购的重要建议：“要获得优秀经理人的美誉，只需确保你收购的是好企业即可。”

多年来，伯克希尔收购了许多公司，最初我全部将它们视为“好生意”。” 但是，最后有些公司却令人失望，有不少简直是彻底的灾难。另一方面，有不少公司却超出了我的期望。

回顾我时好时坏的投资记录时，我得出的结论是，收购就好比婚姻：当然，一开始婚姻是令人开心的，但随后，现实开始偏离婚前的期望。美妙的是，有些时候，新婚夫妇为双方带来了超出预期的幸福。而在另外一些情况下，幻灭也来得很快。将这些画面放到公司收购上面，我不得不说，一般是收购者遇到不愉快的意外情况。在追求收购的阶段，我们总是容易满眼乐观。

按照这种类比，我想说我们的“婚姻”记录大部分还算差强人意，各方皆大欢喜，都很满意很久之前所做的决定。我们的一些合作关系如同田园般惬意。但是，有不少情况，事后很快会使我很纳闷我在“求婚”（编者注：意指提出收购）时到底在想什么，才会做出当时的决定。

幸运的是，我的许多错误导致的后果因大多数令人失望的业务所具有的特点而有所减小：随着时间的流逝，“表现不佳”的公司趋于停滞，随即进入一种状态：即它们的业务对伯克希尔资本的需要占比越来越小。与此同时，“表现良好”的公司往往会继续增长，并以有吸引力的速度找到投资更多资本的机会。由于这两种截然相反的轨迹，伯克希尔的投资胜出者使用的资产逐渐成为我们总资本的一部分。

我们拿伯克希尔最初的纺织业务为例，这是金融运作的一个极端例子。我们于1965年初获得了该公司的控制权，而这个陷入困境的业务几乎需要伯克希尔的全部资本。因此，在一段时间内，伯克希尔的未盈利纺织资产给我们的总体回报拖了严重的后腿。好在最终我们收购了一批“表现良好”的企业，1980年代初的这一转变使得萎缩的纺织业务仅占去了我们一小部分资本。

如今，我们将你们的大部分资金投在能为运营所需的净有形资产带来良好乃至优异回报的可控制企业。我们的保险业务一直是佼佼者。这一业务具有特殊的特征，赋予其校准成功的独特指标，这是许多投资者不熟悉的。我们将在下一章节再作具体讨论。

在接下来的几段中，我们将各种非保险业务按收入规模分组（扣除利息、折旧、税项、非现金补偿、重组费用之后 –所有这些令人讨厌但非常实际的成本，公司的首席执行官们和华尔街有时会告诉投资者们不要理会）。你们可在K-6 – K-21和K-40 – K-52页上阅读有关这些业务的更多信息。

我们的BNSF铁路和伯克希尔哈撒韦能源公司（“ BHE”） – 伯克希尔非保险业务的两大领头羊– 2019年的共计收入83亿美元（仅纳入我们占BHE的91%份额），较2018年增长6%。

按照盈利排名（但下文中是按字母顺序排列的），接下来的五家非保险子公司ClaytonHome、International *MetalWorking*、Lubrizol、Marmon和PrecisionCastpart在2019年的总盈利为48亿美元，与它们在2018年的收入相比变化不大。

再下来的五家子公司（Berkshire Hathaway *Automotive*、Johns Manville、NetJets、Shaw和TTI，同样是按字母顺序排列的）2019年的总盈利为19亿美元，高于2018年的17亿美元。

伯克希尔拥有的其余非保险业务——此类业务有很多——2019年的总盈利为27亿美元，相比之下2018年为28亿美元。

2019年，我们控制的非保险业务净收入总额为177亿美元，较2018年的172亿美元增长了3%。收购和出售对这些结果几乎没有净影响。

我必须补充一点，强调伯克希尔公司的广泛业务范围。2011年，我们收购了总部位于俄亥俄州的Lubrizol公司，这是一家在全球范围内生产和销售石油添加剂的公司。2019 年9月26日，Lubrizol所属的一家法国大型工厂遭遇了一场大火。

这场大火造成了严重的财产损失，路博润的业务也因此遭到了严重破坏。即使如此，公司的财产损失和业务中断损失将通过路博润大量的保险追偿得到缓解。

但是，正如已故的保罗·哈维（Paul Harvey）在他著名的广播节目中所说的，“接下来是故事的结局。”

Lubrizol最大的保险公司之一是伯克希尔旗下的公司。

在马太福音6：3中，圣经指示我们：“你施舍的时候，不要让你的左手知道右手所做的。” 你们的董事长显然是遵照了圣经的嘱咐。

财产/意外险

1967年以来，财产/意外险（P/ C）业务一直是伯克希尔业绩增长的引擎。1967年，伯克希尔以860万美元收购了国民保险公司（National *Indemnity*）及其姊妹公司国民火灾及海事保险公司（National Fire＆*Marine*）。

如今，以净资产衡量，国民保险公司是世界上最大的财产/意外险公司。保险业务重在履行承诺，而伯克希尔履行承诺的能力是无人能比的。

我们被P / C业务吸引的原因之一是该行业的商业模式：P / C保险公司先收取保费后赔付。在极端情况下，一些理赔（如接触石棉，或严重的工作场所事故）的赔付可能持续数十年。

这种“先收取保费，后赔付”的模式让P / C公司持有大笔资金 - 我们称之为“浮存金” - 最终会赔付给其他人。与此同时，保险公司会将这笔浮存金拿去投资获利。虽然个人的保单和理赔来来去去，但保险公司持有的保费收入相关的浮存金一般较为稳定。因此，随着保险业务的增长，浮存金也随之增长。下表所示为浮存金的具体增长情况：

![img](https://n.sinaimg.cn/spider2020223/252/w1398h454/20200223/9cf5-ipvnszf0984578.jpg)

我们偶尔也会遇到浮存金回落。如果浮存出现下滑，下滑幅度将是非常缓慢的- 单一年度最多不超过3%。我们的保险合同的性质决定了我们拥有的现金资源肯定可以满足短期或即时的偿付需求。这种结构是精心设计的，是我们保险公司无与伦比的财力的关键组成部分。这方面的能力绝不会受到冲击。

如果保费收入超过我们的费用和最终损失的总额，保险业务就实现承保利润，从而增加浮存金产生的投资收入。当赚得这样的利润时，我们就可以使用免费资金，而且更好的是，我们还会因为持有这些资金而获得回报。

对于整个财产与意外险行业而言，目前浮存金的财务价值远低于多年前。这是因为几乎所有财产与意外险企业的标准投资战略都严重且恰当地倾向于高级别债券。因此，利率变化对这些企业至关重要，而在过去十年里，债券市场提供的利率低得可怜。

由于保险公司年复一年地被迫（通过到期日或发行人赎回条款）将其“旧”投资组合转换成收益率更低的新持仓，所以保险公司也受到了影响。这些保险公司曾经可以安全地从每一美元的浮存金中赚取5美分或6美分，但现在他们只赚到2美分或3美分（如果他们的业务集中在深陷负利率泥潭的国家，甚至更少）。

一些保险公司可能会试图通过购买低质量债券或承诺高收益的非流动性“另类”投资来减少收入损失。但是，这些都是危险的游戏和活动，大多数机构都没有足够的装备参与这样的危险游戏和活动。

伯克希尔的情况总体上比保险公司要好。最重要的是，我们无与伦比的巨额资本、充裕的现金和多样化的非保险收入，使我们拥有比业内其他公司更大的投资灵活性。我们拥有很多选择，这些选择总是对我们很有利，有时会给我们提供重大的机会。

与此同时，我们的财产与意外险公司有着良好的承保记录。在过去的17年里，伯克希尔有16年实现了承保利润运营，只有2017年例外，当时我们的税前亏损高达32亿美元。在整整17年的时间里，我们的税前利润总计275亿美元，其中2019年实现了4亿美元。

这种记录并非偶然：严格的风险评估是我们保险经理日常关注的焦点，他们知道，糟糕的承保业绩可能会淹没浮存金的回报。所有保险公司都只是嘴上说说而已。

但在伯克希尔，这是一种宗教，旧约风格的宗教。

正如我过去一再做过的那样，我现在要强调的是，保险业的美好结局远非一件确定无疑的事情：在未来17年的16年里，我们几乎肯定不会获得承保利润。危险总是隐藏其中。

评估保险风险的错误可能是巨大的，可能需要很多年甚至几十年的时间才能显现和成熟。一场使卡特里娜飓风和迈克尔飓风相形见绌的大灾难将会发生，也许是明天，也许是几十年后。“最大的灾难”可能来自传统来源，如风或者地震，也可能是完全出乎意料的，比如网络攻击的灾难性后果超出了保险公司目前的预期。当这样的大灾难来袭时，伯克希尔就会得到它的损失份额，而且损失将会很大，非常大。然而，与许多其他保险公司不同，处理损失不会接近于耗尽我们的资源，我们将急于在第二天就增加我们的业务。

闭上眼睛，试着想象一个可能会产生动态财产与意外险保险公司的地方。纽约？伦敦？硅谷？

威尔克斯-巴里（Wilkes-Barre）怎么样？

2012年末，我们保险业务非常宝贵的经理阿吉特-杰恩（Ajit Jain）打电话告诉我，他将以2.21亿美元（约合当时公司的资产净值）的价格收购宾夕法尼亚州那个小城的一家小公司 - GUARD Insurance Group。他还说，GUARD首席执行官赛-福格尔（Sy *Foguel*）将成为伯克希尔的明星。GUARD和赛都是我的新名字。

转眼之间：2019年，GUARD的保费收入达到19亿美元，较2012年增长了379%，承保利润也令人满意。自从加入伯克希尔以来，赛带领公司进入了新产品和新地区，并将GUARD的浮存金增加了265%。

1967年，奥马哈似乎不太可能成为一个财产与意外险的巨头跳板。威尔克斯-巴里很可能会带来类似的惊喜。

伯克希尔哈撒韦能源公司（Berkshire HathawayEnergy）

伯克希尔哈撒韦能源公司正在庆祝其在我们旗下的第20个年头。周年纪念日表明我们应该在赶超公司的成就。

我们就从电价这个话题开始。当伯克希尔在2000年进入公用事业领域时，它收购了BHE 76%的股份，该公司在爱荷华州的居民客户的平均千瓦时电价为8.8美分。

自那之后，居民客户的电价每年上涨不到1%，我们承诺，到2028年，基本电价不会上涨。相比之下，爱荷华州另一家大型投资公司的情况是：去年，该公司对居民客户收取的电价比BHE高出61%。最近，公用事业公司的费率上涨，将使这一差距扩大到70%。

我们和他们之间的巨大差异很大程度上是由于我们在将风能转化为电能方面取得的巨大成就。2021年，我们预计BHE在爱荷华州的运营将通过其拥有和运营的风力涡轮机产生约2520万兆瓦时的电力。这样的电力产量将完全满足其爱荷华州客户的年度需求，其约为2460万兆瓦时。换句话说，我们的公用事业公司将在爱荷华州实现风能自给自足。

与此形成鲜明对比的是，爱荷华州的另一家公用事业公司，风力发电不足总发电量的10%。此外，据我们所知，到2021年，无论在哪里，其他投资者拥有的公用事业公司都不可能实现风能自给自足。2000年，BHE服务于农业经济；如今，它的五大客户中有三个客户是高科技巨头。我认为，他们在爱荷华州建厂的决定部分是基于BHE提供可再生、低成本能源的能力。

当然，风是断断续续的，我们在爱荷华州的叶片只转动了部分时间。在某些时段，当空气静止时，我们依靠非风力发电的能力来保证我们所需的电力。在情况相反的时候，我们将风能提供给我们的多余电力卖给其他公用事业公司，通过所谓的“电网”为他们服务。我们卖给他们的电力替代了他们对碳资源的需求，比如煤或者天然气。

伯克希尔哈撒韦目前与小沃尔特-斯科特（Walter Scott, Jr.）和格雷格-阿贝尔（Greg Abel）共同持有BHE 91%的股份。自从我们收购以来，BHE从未向伯克希尔哈撒韦支付过股息，而且随着时间的流逝，BHE保留了280亿美元的盈利。这种模式在公用事业领域是个例外，公用事业公司通常会支付高额股息，有时甚至超过80%的盈利。我们的观点是：我们可以投资的越多，我们就越青睐它。

今天，BHE拥有运营人才和经验来管理真正的大型公用事业项目，这些项目需要1000亿美元或更多的投资，能够支持造福我们的国家、我们的社区和我们的股东的基础设施。

投资

以下所列出的是截至去年年底我们所持市值最大的15只普通股。在此，我们排除了卡夫亨氏的持股（325442152股），因为伯克希尔本身只是控股集团的一部分，所以必须用“股权”的方法来解释这笔投资。在伯克希尔的资产负债表上，若按通用会计准则计算，伯克希尔所持卡夫亨氏的股份价值138亿美元，相当于2019年12月31日伯克希尔在卡夫亨氏经审计的净值中所占份额。到去年年底，我们在卡夫亨氏的持股市值仅为105亿美元。

伯克希尔持股市值最大的15只股票（截止2019年12月31日）：

\* 不包括伯克希尔子公司的养老基金所持有的股份。

** 这是我们的实际购买价格，也是我们的计税基础。

***包括对西方石油公司数额为100亿美元的投资。这笔投资由优先股以及可购买普通股的认股权证组成。

查理和我都没有把以上这些股票（总计持股市值2480亿美元）当作是精心收集的潜力股。当前这场金融闹剧将要结束，因为“华尔街”的降级、美联储可能采取的行动、可能出现的政治动向、经济学家的预测，或者其他任何可能成为当前热门话题的东西，都将终止这场闹剧。

相反，我们把这些公司看作是一个我们进行部分持股的集合。若按加权计算，这些公司运营业务所需的有形净资产净利超过20%。这些公司不需要过度举债就可以盈利。

在任何情况下，那些规模巨大、成熟且易于理解的企业的订单回报率都是引人瞩目的。与很多投资者在过去十年里所接受的债券回报率（比如说30年期美国国债的收益率是2.5%或更低）相比，这些公司的回报率的确令人感到兴奋。

查理和我从来不喜欢玩预测利率的游戏，因为我们不知道未来一年、十年或三十年里利率的平均值是多少。我们或许有些偏见地认为，在这个话题上发表意见的权威人士，恰恰是通过这种行为，透露出的更多的是和他们自己有关的信息，而不是关于未来的信息。

我们可以说的是，如果在未来几十年里和当前利率接近的利率占上风，公司税也维持在企业当下正在享受着的低水平，那么几乎可以肯定的是，随着时间的推移，股票的表现将远远好于长期固定利率债务工具。

在给出这一乐观预测的同时，我们也要发出一项警告：未来股价可能会发生任何变化。有时，股市会暴跌，幅度可能是50%，也可能会更大。但是，对于那些不用借钱来炒股、且能够控制自己情绪的人来说，去年我曾在文章中写过的“美国经济顺风车”，再加上史密斯所谓的“复合奇迹”，会助推股票成为更好的长期选择。其他人呢？当心！

未来的路

30年前，我的朋友约瑟夫·罗森菲尔德（家住美国中西部），收到了当地一家报纸发来的一封信。这封信让罗森菲尔德很恼火，当时他已经80多岁了。报纸直截了当地要求乔提供一些生平数据，准备在他去世后用在他的讣告中。罗森菲尔德没有回信。接下来怎么样呢？1个月后，他收到了那家报纸发来的第二封信，而且还是封加急信。

查理和我很糟就已经进入了类似的“加急”阶段。对于我们来说，这显然不是什么喜讯。但是，伯克希尔的股东们不必焦虑：你的公司已经为我们的离开做好了百分百的准备。

我们之所以如此乐观，主要基于五大原因：

第一，伯克希尔的资产部署在各种各样的全资或部分拥有的企业身上，这些企业的资本回报率很吸引人。

第二，伯克希尔将旗下所控制业务定位在一个单一实体，这种现状赋予了该公司一些重要且持久的经济优势。

第三，伯克希尔将一如既往地以一种可让本公司抵御极端外部冲击的方式来管理财务事务。

第四，我们拥有经验丰富且忠心耿耿的顶尖经理人。对于他们来说，管理伯克希尔远远不止是一份高薪和/或有声望的工作。

第五，伯克希尔的董事们——你们的监护人——一直专注于股东的福利，以及培育一种在超大型企业中很罕见的文化。（拉里-坎宁安和斯蒂芬妮-古巴在合著的新书《信任的边缘》中探讨了这种文化的价值。在我们的年会上，可以看到这本书。）

还有一些特别实际的原因促使查理和我想要确保伯克希尔在我们离开后的日子里继续繁荣昌盛：芒格家族持有的伯克希尔股票规模，远超过该家族的其他投资；我高达99%的净身价靠的是伯克希尔股票。我从来没有卖过伯克希尔股票，以后也不打算这么做。

除了慈善捐赠和送人小礼物之外，我唯一一次动过伯克希尔股票，是在1980年。当年，我和其他被选出的伯克希尔股东们，用伯克希尔的一些股票换了伊利诺斯州一家银行的股票。早在1969年，伯克希尔收购了这家银行。1980年，因为银行控股公司法的变化，我们必须卸载该行。

今天，我在遗嘱中已经明确指明了执行人——以及在遗嘱关闭后接替他们管理我的遗产的受托人——不要出售伯克希尔股票。我的遗嘱还免除了遗嘱执行人和受托人的责任，因为他们要维持的显然是极度集中的资产。

根据我的遗嘱，执行人以及受托人每年会将我的一部分A股转换成B股，然后将B股分发给不同的基金会。这些基金会将被要求迅速分配所获得的捐款。总的来说，据我估算，在我去世12年-15年后我所持有的伯克希尔股票会进入市场。

没有我遗嘱的指令，直到安排好的分配日期之前，我所持有的所有伯克希尔股票应该不会易主。在安排好的日期，我的遗嘱执行人和受托人将会在他们的临时控制下出售伯克希尔股票，并且对到期的美国国债进行再投资。这样的策略将使受托人免受公众的批评，也免于因未能按照“谨慎的人”标准行事而承担个人责任的可能性。

我本人感到安心的是，在处置期内，伯克希尔的股票将可提供一种安全的、有回报的投资。也许会发生一些事件证明我是错的，这种可能性总是存在的——可能性不大，但也不能忽略不计。但我相信，与传统的行动方案相比，我的指示很可能会为社会提供更多的资源。

就我“只限伯克希尔”的指示而言，其关键在于我对伯克希尔的董事们未来的判断力和忠诚度抱有信心。他们经常都会面临华尔街人士的考验，与其争夺服务费。对许多公司来说，这些华尔街“超级销售员”可能会胜出。但我预计，在伯克希尔不会出现这种情况。

董事会

近年以来，企业董事会的构成及其宗旨都已成为人们关注的热点问题。在以前，有关董事会责任的争论在很大程度上仅限于在律师们之间展开；而在今天，机构投资者和政治家们也加入了进来。

就讨论企业治理的问题而言，我的资历包括，在过去62年时间里，我曾担任21家上市公司（详见下文横线以下部分）的董事。除了两家公司之外，我在其他公司中都持有并代表着大量股权。在少数公司中，我曾试图实施重要的改变。

在我服务于这些公司的最初30年左右的时间里，董事会中很少会有女性，除非她代表着企业的控股家族。应该指出的是，今年是第19修正案出台100周年，该修正案保障了美国妇女投票发声的权利。她们在董事会中获得类似地位的工作则仍在进行中。

多年以来，许多有关董事会组成和职责的新规则和指导方针已经出台。然而，董事们面临的根本挑战一如既往：找到并留住一位才华横溢的首席执行官——当然，还需要诚实正直的品质——并将自己的整个商业生涯都奉献给公司。通常情况下，这项任务是艰巨的。但是，一旦董事们做对这件事情，其他就什么都不用做了。但是，如果他们搞砸了这件事......

审计委员会会比以往更加努力地工作，并且几乎总是以严苛的态度看待这项工作。尽管如此，但是这些委员会的目标与管理者的期望不符，这实际上是一种“犯罪行为”，因为收益“指导”的祸害和首席执行官“达到预期数字”的愿望鼓励了这一行为。根据我与曾与公司数字CEO打交道的直接经验（谢天谢地，只是有限的经验）表明，更多情况下，他们通常是自我推动，而不是出于对经济利益的渴望。

薪酬委员会现在比以往更多地依赖顾问。因此，补偿安排变得更加复杂-哪个委员会成员能够解释为一个简单的计划年复一年地支付大笔费用？而且阅读代理材料已成为一种令人麻木的经历。

公司治理方面的一项非常重要的改进已得到授权：定期组织董事“执行会议”，禁止首席执行官参加。在此之前，很少有关于首席执行官的职能，收购决策和薪酬的坦率讨论。

收购提案对于董事会成员而言仍然是一个特别棘手的问题。进行交易的法律流程已得到完善和扩展（也恰当地描述了相关的费用）。但是我还没有看到渴望进行收购的首席执行官会招来一位熟悉内情且理智的批评家来反对他。是的，这一点也包括我在内。

伯克希尔、Blue Chip *Stamp*、Cap Cities-ABC、可口可乐、Data Documents、Dempster、General Growth、吉列、卡夫亨氏、*Maracaibo* Oil、Munsingears、奥马哈国民银行、Pinkerton’s、PortlandGas Light、所罗门公司、Sanborn Map、TribuneOil、美国航空、Vornado、华盛顿邮报公司、Wesco Financial。

总体而言，如今台面上摆满了首席执行官和他/她员工们喜闻乐见的交易方案。对于一家公司来说，聘请两名“专家”收购顾问（一名赞成，一名反对）向董事会传达他或她对拟议中交易的看法将是一项有趣的做法。比方说，最终意见获得采纳的顾问将获得另一位顾问酬劳的10倍作为奖励。但不要屏息等待这项改革（的到来）：当前的制度，无论对股东来说有什么缺点，对首席执行官和许多享受交易的顾问和其他专业人士来说都非常有效。当我们考虑到华尔街的建议时，一个古老的警告永远是正确的：不要问理发师你是否需要理发。

多年来，董事会“独立性”已成为一个新的值得关注的话题。然而，与这个话题相关的一个关键点几乎总是被忽视，那就是董事薪酬现在飙升到了一个水平，一个不可避免地使薪酬成为影响许多并不富裕董事成员潜意识行为的水平。试想一下，一位董事一年六次左右，花上几天“舒适”时间开董事会会议，收入就可以在25万至30万美元之间。通常，拥有一个这样董事职位人的收入是美国家庭年收入中位数的三到四倍（我曾错过了这样一个富足的机会：在20世纪60年代初，作为PortlandGas Light的董事，我每年的服务报酬为100美元。为了赚到这笔可观的收入，我每年需要往返缅因州四次）。

现在（董事）工作有保障吗？是的。董事会成员可能会被“礼貌地”忽视，但他们却很少被解雇。取代之的是，相当宽松的年龄限制（通常是70岁或更高）被视为是礼貌驱逐公司董事的标准行事方法。

难怪一位不富有的董事（non-*wealthy* director，简称“NWD”）现在希望、甚至渴望被邀请加入第二家公司的董事会，从而帮助自己跃升至50-60万美元的收入阶层。为了实现这一目标，NWD将需要一些帮助。一家寻找董事会成员的公司CEO几乎肯定会向NWD的现任CEO核实NWD是否是一个“好”董事。当然，所谓的“好”只是个暗号。如果NWD严重挑战他/她现任CEO的薪酬或收购梦想，他/她的（董事）候选人资格将悄无声息地抹去。在寻找董事时，首席执行官们并不是在寻找斗牛犬，只有可卡犬会被带回家。

尽管不合逻辑，但如今几乎所有董事都被归类为“独立（董事）”，然而许多拥有与公司兴衰密切相关的董事又被认为缺乏这一独立性。不久前，我查看了一家美国大公司的委托书材料，发现有8名董事从未用自己的钱购买过该公司股票（当然，他们得到了股票奖励，作为自己丰厚现金薪酬的补充）。这家公司长期以来一直（表现）落后，但董事们待遇却非常好。

当然，用自己的钱购买所有权并不能创造智慧，也不能确保商业成功。然而，当我们投资组合内公司的董事有用他们自己钱购买股票的经验，而不是简单地获赠时，我会感觉更好。

在这里，我应该停顿一下：我想让你知道，这些年来我见过的几乎所有董事都很像样、讨人喜欢且聪明。他们衣着光鲜，是好邻居、也是好公民，我很享受他们的陪伴。在这群人中，有一些人如果不是因为我们共同的董事会服务，我是不会认识他们的，他们如今已经成为了我亲密的朋友。

然而，这些善良的人中有许多是我永远不会选择来处理金钱或商业事务的人。因为这根本不是他们的游戏场。

反过来，他们也永远不会在拔牙、装修房子或改善高尔夫球技方面向我求助。此外，如果我被安排在“与星共舞”（*Dancing* With The Stars）节目中露面，我会立即寻求证人保护计划的庇护。我们总会在这件事或那件事上无所建树。对于我们大多数人来说，这个（无所建树的）清单很长。但需要认识到的重要一点是，如果你是鲍比·费舍尔（*Bobby* Fischer，美国国际象棋棋手），你必须为了钱而下棋。

在伯克希尔，我们将继续寻找精通商业的董事，他们以主人翁精神为导向，并对我们的公司有强烈的特定兴趣。思想和原则，而不是[机器人](http://finance.sina.com.cn/realstock/company/sz300024/nc.shtml)(10.220, -0.20, -1.92%)般的“流程”将指导他们的行动。当然，在代表你的利益（进行投资）时，他们会寻找用心取悦客户、珍惜自己同事、努力成为自己所在社区和国家好公民的经理人。

这些目标并不新鲜。这是60年前有能力CEO们的目标，现在仍是如此。否则又有谁该具备这些能力呢？

其他内容

在过去的报告中，我们已经讨论了股票回购的意义和无用性。我们的想法归结为：伯克希尔只有在以下情况下才会回购股票：a）查理和我认为它的售价低于其价值，以及b）公司在完成回购后，仍会拥有充足的现金。

（股票）内在价值的计算很不精确。因此，我们两人都没有对以非常真实的95美分购买估值为1美元的商品感到任何紧迫性，。2019年，伯克希尔的价格/价值等式有时是适度有利（股票回购）的，我们花了50亿美元回购了公司约1%的股份。

随着时间的推移，我们希望伯克希尔的股票数量下降。如果股价低于实际价值的情况（正如我们估计的那样）继续发生，我们很可能会在回购股票上变得更加积极。然而，我们不会在任何水平支撑股价。

持有价值至少2000万美元A类股或B类股，并有意向伯克希尔出售股票的股东可能希望他们的经纪人联系伯克希尔的马克·米勒德（Mark Millard），电话是402-346-1400。我们需要您在打定主意出售股票的情况下，在中部时间上午8：00-8：30或下午3：00-3：30之间给马克打电话。

2019年，伯克希尔向美国财政部汇出36亿美元，用于支付当前所得税。同期，美国政府收到了2430亿美元的企业所得税。从这些统计数据中，你可以为你的公司缴纳了美国所有公司缴纳联邦所得税的1.5%而感到自豪。

55年前，当伯克希尔进入当下的企业集团结构时，公司无需缴纳联邦所得税（这也是有充分理由的：因为在此前十年里，这家苦苦挣扎的企业录得净亏损）。从那时起，由于伯克希尔保留了几乎所有的收益，这项政策的受益者已不仅仅是公司股东，联邦政府也同样受益。（因为）在未来的大部分时间里，我们都希望并期待着向财政部上缴更大的金额。

在A-2-A-3页，您可以找到我们将于2020年5月2日举行年会的详细情况。像往常一样，雅虎将在全球范围内直播这一活动。然而，我们的形式将有一个重要的变化：股东、媒体和董事会成员建议，让我们的两位关键运营经理阿吉特·贾因（Ajit Jain）和格雷格·阿贝尔（Greg Abel）在年会上有更多的曝光率。这一变化非常有意义。无论是作为经理人还是个人，他们都是杰出的个体，你应该从他们那里听到更多。

今年发送问题给我们三名长期任职新闻人员的股东可以指定向阿吉特或格雷格提出问题。就像查理和我一样，他们也将完全不知道这些问题是什么。

记者将与观众轮流提问，观众也可以直接向我们四个人中的任何一个提问。所以，请擦亮你的獠牙。

今年5月2日，欢迎来奥马哈。在这里见见你的资本家同行，购买一些伯克希尔产品，尽情享受。查理和我，还有整个伯克希尔家庭都期待着见到你。

2020年2月22日

沃伦·E·巴菲特。

董事局主席

THE TOP LINE THAT WE WOULD 

92
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:21,540
TRADITIONALLY LOOK AT WE SEE 

93
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,707

94
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,377
BILLION IN REVENUE FROM THE 

95
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:27,646
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY EMPIRE.

96
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:29,247
INVESTMENT GAINS, $5.7 BILLION.

97
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,717
I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR FROM WARREN 

98
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:32,651
AND CHARLIE A LOT ABOUT THAT 

99
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,819
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE 

100
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,654
ACCOUNTING CHANGE THAT BERKSHIRE

101
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,322
AND ALL COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED 

102
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,490
TO GO THROUGH A COUPLE OF YEARS 

103
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,992
AGO.

104
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,059
OPERATING PROFITS, JUST OVER $7 

105
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,561
BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER.

106
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:44,630
THE COMPANY PROVIDED A LITTLE 

107
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:49,501
BIT OF COLOR THAT I DO WANT TO 

108
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:51,036
CALL OUT IN ITS UTILITIES 

109
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:53,471
BUSINESS, EARNINGS UP 20%.

110
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:55,273
WE ARE LACKING SOME COVID 

111
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:56,508
COMPARABLES AND WE'VE SEEN THAT 

112
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,075
THROUGHOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF 

113
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,310
WEEKS.

114
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,711
THEN IN ITS MANUFACTURING 

115
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,146
SERVICE AND RETAILING BUSINESSES

116
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:04,282
THOSE EARNINGS WERE UP JUST 

117
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:05,684
UNDER 30%, 28.5% DURING THE 

118
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:07,485
FIRST QUARTER.

119
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:09,321
WE HEAR SO OFTEN FROM MAJOR 

120
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:11,423
CORPORATIONS ABOUT THE WAY THAT 

121
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:13,225
THE PANDEMIC RECOVERY OR WE 

122
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,393
SHOULD JUST SAY THE RECOVERY OUT

123
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,762
OF THE PANDEMIC-INDUCED 

124
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,262
RECESSION IS HELPING THEIR 

125
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,632
BUSINESSES.

126
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,533
IT SEEMS SO FAR LIKE BERKSHIRE 

127
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:23,435
HATHAWAY IS NO EXCEPTION.

128
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,736
JULIA LaROCHE, SOMETHING ELSE 

129
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,238
WE'VE SEEN IN THIS EARNINGS 

130
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,707
RELEASE AND WE KNOW WE'RE GOING 

131
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,442
TO HEAR FROM WARREN AND CHARLIE 

132
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,510
ABOUT IS THE CASH AND THE BUY 

133
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,811
BACK PROGRAM THAT CONTINUED IN 

134
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,879
THE FIRST QUARTER. 

135
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:36,281
>> THAT'S RIGHT, MYLES.

136
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,549
I'M SURE WE'LL GET SOME COLOR ON

137
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:41,253
THOSE SHARE REPURCHASES AND 

138
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:42,921
SHARE REPURCHASES HITTING A 

139
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,590
RECORD IN 2020 AND CONTINUING IN

140
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,091
THE FIRST QUARTER.

141
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,658
SOMETHING SHAREHOLDERS ALWAYS 

142
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,762
LOOK TOWARD.

143
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:55,033
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WILL 

144
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:58,036
CERT

145
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,604
CERTAINLY BE FOLLOWING IS THE 

146
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,873
INCREDIBLE FRIENDS.

147
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:03,475
WHEN YOU TALK TO WARREN BUFFETT,

148
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,211
HE TALKS ABOUT HOW CHARLIE 

149
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:07,279
MUNGER MADE HIM A, QUOTE, BETTER

150
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,248
PERSON.

151
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,417
WHILE BUFFETT IS OFTEN VIEWED AS

152
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,818
THE PUBLIC FACE OF BERKSHIRE 

153
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:15,154
HATHAWAY, THE COMPANY AS WE KNOW

154
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:17,656
IT TODAY WAS ACTUALLY BUILT IN 

155
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,791
THE BLUEPRINT OF CHARLIE MUNGER,

156
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,892
WHO IS ALSO -- YOU KNOW, DOES 

157
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,694
DABBLE IN ARCHITECTURE.

158
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,229
I THINK THIS WILL BE A MOMENT 

159
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:26,265
WHERE THERE WILL BE A LOT MORE 

160
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,933
ATTENTION ON MUNGER.

161
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:31,537
HE'S 97 YEARS OLD.

162
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,074
A POLY MATH INVESTOR WITH 

163
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:37,342
KNOWLEDGE, HUMOR, WITT.

164
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,610
ALWAYS SOME COLORFUL LANGUAGE AT

165
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,878
THE BERKSHIRE MEETING.

166
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,612
IT IS BEING HELD IN LOS ANGELES 

167
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,948
THIS YEAR.

168
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:48,586
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUFFETT 

169
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:52,991
WAS IN THE CHI HELP ARENA AND 

170
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:56,962
WITHOUT HIS LONG-TIME COLLEAGUE.

171
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:59,464
WE HAD A GREAT COLUMN FROM ANDY 

172
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:01,032
SERWER AND AKIKO, I KNOW YOU'LL 

173
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,534
BE MONITORING THAT CASH PILE 

174
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,802
THAT SEEMS TO BE GROWING.

175
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,971
I KNOW IT GREW IN THE QUARTER.

176
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:07,672
IF WE'LL GET ANY COLOR FROM THE 

177
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,340
INVESTORS ON WHAT THEY'LL DO 

178
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,409
WITH THAT.

179
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,244
>> YEAH, NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

180
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:15,714
MYLES JUST ELUDED TO IT.

181
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:16,915
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT $155.4 

182
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,784
BILLION IN CASH IN THE END OF 

183
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:22,120
THE FIRST QUARTER.

184
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:23,221
WE'VE HEARD WARREN BUFFETT TAUT 

185
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,123
THIS ACQUISITION.

186
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:27,292
LAST YEAR AT THE MEETING HE SAID

187
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,327
HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING YET.

188
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,695
HE HASN'T FOUND ANYTHING THAT IS

189
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,563
THAT ATTRACTIVE.

190
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,265
I'D BE CURIOUS TO SEE IF HE'S 

191
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,401
GOT HIS EYE ON SOMETHING NOW, IF

192
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,701
HIS THOUGHTS HAVE CHANGED ON 

193
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,135
THAT FRONT.

194
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,603
IT WILL BE ALSO INTERESTING TO 

195
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,504
SEE HOW HE'S VIEWING THE MARKET 

196
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,140
CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW.

197
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:43,208
REMEMBER A YEAR AGO HE MADE SOME

198
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:46,044
HEADLINES WHEN HE EXITED THOSE 

199
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,546
BIG POSITIONS IN AIRLINES, 

200
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,180
UNITED, DELTA, SOUTHWEST, 

201
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,182
AMERICAN.

202
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,883
SINCE THEN WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF 

203
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,752
THOSE STOCKS RALLY TRIPLE DIGITS

204
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,786
SINCE THE PANDEMIC LOW.

205
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,721
IS HE MAYBE RECONSIDERING SOME 

206
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,788
OF THOSE POSITIONS?

207
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:00,125
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.

208
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:02,227
AND THEN FINALLY SOMETHING THAT 

209
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,795
ANDY JUST ALLUDED TO IN THE 

210
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,097
OPENING IS HOW HE'S LOOKING AT 

211
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:08,333
WHAT WE'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER 

212
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:10,202
AS THE FROTH IN THE MARKET.

213
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,337
BITCOIN CERTAINLY I IMAGINE WILL

214
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,537
COME UP AS A POINT OF DISCUSSION

215
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,305
HERE.

216
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:16,241
WE'VE HEARD WARREN BUFFETT 

217
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:18,777
DISMISS THEM, THE CRYPTOCURRENCY

218
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,746
AS HAVING NO VALUE BEFORE, 

219
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:22,981
CALLING IT RAT POISON SQUARED.

220
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:26,017
CHARLIE MUNGER CERTAINLY NO FAN 

221
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:27,386
SAYING PURSUIT OF THE UNEATABLE 

222
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:29,554
BY THE UNSPEAKABLE.

223
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:31,923
WE'RE SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT

224
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:39,998
BITCOIN RALLYING, WHAT, 90% SO 

225
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:41,800

WE HAVE CAR REN WALLACE, 

229
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,640
MORNINGSTAR DIRECTOR OF INVESTOR

EDUCATION.

231
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:52,010
KAREN, YOU'VE HEARD US PREVIEW 

232
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,945
OF WHAT COULD COME UP 

233
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,780
POTENTIALLY AS QUESTIONS IN THIS

234
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,448
SHAREHOLDER MEETING.

235
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:57,249
WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU GOING 

236
00:16:56,514 --> 00:17:00,051
TO BE LOOKING FOR?

237
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:01,319
>> A LOT OF THE THINGS YOU'RE 

238
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:02,120
MENTIONING HAVE BEEN ON MY MIND 

239
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:04,389
AS WELL.

240
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,023
THE FEAR OF MISSING OUT.

241
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,925
SPECULATION.

242
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:09,627
YOU KNOW, BUFFETT AND MUNGER 

243
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:11,263
DON'T REALLY LIKE TO SPECULATE 

244
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:13,298
WITH THEIR SHAREHOLDERS MONEY.

245
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:16,167
THE THING ABOUT WARREN BUFFETT, 

246
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:18,303
HE DIDN'T STRIKE OIL OR DEVELOP 

247
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:20,805
SOFTWARE AND INHERIT A BIG PILE 

248
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,607
OF MONEY, HE BUILT HIS FORTUNE 

249
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:24,209
BY PICKING SOLID BUSINESSES THAT

250
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,277
GENERATE A LOT OF CASH AND HE 

251
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,644
BELIEVES WILL CONTINUE TO DO 

252
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,612
WELL.

253
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,845
YOU KNOW, HE TAKES THE CASH FROM

254
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,015
THAT.

255
00:17:27,912 --> 00:17:31,516
HE REINVESTS.

256
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,552
HE HOLDS ON FOR THE LONG TERM.

257
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,754
HE LOOKS FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES.

258
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,589
HE WANTS BUSINESSES THAT HE CAN 

259
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:40,358
UNDERSTAND, WHICH IS A BIG PART 

260
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:41,259
OF IT, THEN YOU CAN MORE 

261
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:42,660
ACCURATELY VALUE A BUSINESS IF 

262
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,262
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT DOES.

263
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:47,165
HE WANTS BUSINESSES THAT HAVE 

264
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:49,167
GOOD LONG-TERM PROSPECTS.

265
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,434
FEAR OF MISSING OUT IS HIS 

266
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,902
THING.

267
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,203
HE WANTS BUSINESSES RUN BY 

268
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,639
HONEST AND COMPETENT PEOPLE 

269
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:57,275
BECAUSE THIS IS A LONG-TERM 

270
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,776
RELATIONSHIP AND HE WANTS ALL OF

271
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:01,646
THAT AT AN ATTRACTIVE PRICE 

272
00:17:58,843 --> 00:18:03,582
WHICH AS YOU'RE BOTH ALLUDING 

273
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,683
TO, THERE'S NOT TOO MANY 

274
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,451
OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE.

275
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,653
YOU KNOW, HIGH QUALITY 

276
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:10,755
BUSINESSES LIKE THIS DON'T GO ON

277
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,824
SALE VERY OFTEN BUT BUFFETT IS A

278
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:14,592
PATIENT -- HE'S A PATIENT 

279
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,727
INVESTOR AND HE CAN WAIT FOR 

280
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,563
EXACTLY THE RIGHT PITCH.

281
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:19,631
TO INCREASE HIS SUCCESS RATE HE 

282
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,232
DOES LOOK FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE

283
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:23,468
SELLING FOR LESS THAN HIS 

284
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,470
ESTIMATE OF THEIR FAIR VALUE 

285
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:27,139
WHICH GIVES HIM SOME LEEWAY IN 

286
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,739
CASE HIS ESTIMATE ISN'T EXACTLY 

287
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,740
RIGHT.

288
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,608
BUT ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT 

289
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,277
PART OF HIS STRATEGY IS LOOKING 

290
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:33,311
FOR COMPANIES THAT HAVE 

291
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:38,817
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OR WHAT 

292
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:41,986
HE REFERS TO AS ECONOMIC MOATS, 

293
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:44,990
MOATS AROUND THE CASTLE 

294
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:45,257
PROTECTING THE CASTLE AND THE 

295
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,525
BUSINESS. 

296
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,893
>> KAREN, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT 

297
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:54,632
REPORTS THAT INDICATE THAT SOME 

298
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,634
SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT BE A LITTLE 

299
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:58,136
DISGRUNTLED ABOUT THE 

300
00:18:56,701 --> 00:19:00,872
PERFORMANCE OF THE BERKSHIRE 

301
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,940
STOCK AND THE DIVERSITY AND 

302
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,774
INCLUSION, CLIMATE CHANGE, 

303
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,775
DIRECTORS AND COMPENSATION.

304
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:07,278
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

305
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:09,280
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, HE HAS TRIED 

306
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:11,917
TO KIND OF PUT THAT INTO THE 

307
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:12,250
HANDS OF THE COMPANY MANAGEMENT 

308
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,285
BEFORE.

309
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,553
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW 

310
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:18,089
THAT QUESTION IS ANSWERED 

311
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,824
BECAUSE I THINK A LOT MORE 

312
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,825
PRESSURE, OBVIOUSLY I HAVEN'T 

313
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,260
BEEN TO THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING 

314
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:23,661
PERSONALLY SINCE 2019, BUT I 

315
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:28,767
REMEMBER A LOT MORE QUESTIONS 

316
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:30,401
COMING UP ABOUT THAT.

317
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,736
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW 

318
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:35,573
THAT'S ANSWERED BECAUSE I REALLY

319
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:37,709
DO KIND OF THINK THAT HIS VIEW 

320
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,978
IS THAT, YOU KNOW, THE COMPANY 

321
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:43,414
MANAGERS KIND OF ALLOCATE THEIR 

322
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:44,750
OWN CAPITAL AND THEY MAKE THEIR 

323
00:19:43,481 --> 00:20:13,711
DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES, BUT IT

324
00:19:44,816 --> 00:20:15,213
IS BECOMING SOMETHING MORE. 

325
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:17,148
>> WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS SUCH

326
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,285
A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT MEETING

327
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:22,387
FOR THEM TO PAY ATTENTION TO?

328
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:25,790
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THE CORNER 

329
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:27,492
STONE OF OUR EQUITY VALUATION AT

330
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,894
MORNINGSTAR, WE BORROWED A LOT 

331
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,529
OF BUFFETT'S WISDOM.

332
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:33,765
YOU KNOW, WE LOOK FOR COMPANIES 

333
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:36,701
THAT -- YOU KNOW, SO WHEN A 

334
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:39,771
COMPANY'S KIND OF -- WHEN ITS 

335
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:41,906
RETURNS ON CAPITAL ARE EXCEEDING

336
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,875
COST ON CAPITAL FOR A LONG TIME,

337
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:44,076
THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT, 

338
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,910
RIGHT?

339
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:48,346
THE BUSINESSES OFTEN HAVE SOME 

340
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:49,648
SORT OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, 

341
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:52,651
SUSTAINABLE, OR THAT'S ENDURING,

342
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:53,785
AND BUFFETT REFERS TO THAT AS AN

343
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:57,255
ECONOMIC MOAT.

344
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:59,324
I THINK SEARCHING FOR THESE 

345
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,991
MOATS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN 

346
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,025
EVER.

347
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,026
ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE 

348
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:03,361
KINDS OF BUSINESS THAT 

349
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:04,329
BUFFETT -- THE KINDS OF 

350
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,064
BUSINESSES THAT BUFFETT IS 

351
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:08,233
INTERESTED IN INVESTING IN, 

352
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,268
THEY'RE CASH POWERHOUSES, THINGS

353
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,003
LIKE INSURANCE, BANKING, 

354
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,804
CONSUMER PRODUCTS, 

355
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,072
PHARMACEUTICALS.

356
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:18,610
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE THINGS THAT 

357
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:21,212
KIND OF HOLD UP WELL, YOU KNOW,

00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:23,715
AND THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY

359
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,050
FOR HIM TO REINVEST IN THE 

360
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,151
BUSINESS, TO BUY BACK SHARES, 

361
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,153
TO, YOU KNOW, INVEST IN THE

00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:30,789

EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF, YOU

00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:35,026
KNOW, A BIG, ATTRACTIVE 

365
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:35,259
ACQUISITION THAT COULD MOVE THE 

366
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,895
NEEDLE.

367
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:40,332
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD FOR BUFFETT 

368
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:44,669
TO FIND -- HARD FOR BERKSHIRE TO

369
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:47,305
FIND SOMETHING LARGE ENOUGH FOR 

370
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:48,807
IT TO MOVE THE NEEDLE IN TERMS 

371
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,375
OF OUR EARNINGS, YOU KNOW, IN 

372
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:51,976

THE OVERALL EARNINGS OF THE 

374
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:53,845
COMPANY. 

375
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,747
>> KAREN, I'M CURIOUS ALSO ABOUT

376
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:59,984
THE STRUCTURE OF BERKSHIRE.

377
00:21:55,814 --> 00:22:00,217
AS A CONGLOMERATE, IT'S OUT 

378
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:02,653
MOATED.

379
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:04,556
NEW INVESTORS DON'T REALIZE THE 

380
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,856
HISTORY OF THE CONGLOMERATE 

381
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,658
STRUCTURE.

382
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:08,326
BUFFETT WROTE ABOUT THAT IN THIS

383

00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,828
I'M WONDERING IF YOU WERE 

385
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:15,467
THINKING ABOUT BERKSHIRE AS THE 

386
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:16,968
LAST OF ITS KIND OFR DO SOME OF 

387
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:18,903
THE BIG COMPANIES TRY TO EMULATE

388
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,838
THAT STRUCTURE AS THEY MATURE IN

389
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,439
THEIR LIFE CYCLE?

390
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,274
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING 

391
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:27,412
BECAUSE IT'S A COLLECTION -- 

392
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:29,447
IT'S SORT OF A COLLECTION OF 

393
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:31,315
MOATY BUSINESSES.

394
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,483
OUR ANALYST GREG WARREN TALKS 

395
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:35,119
ABOUT INSURANCE ISN'T THE KIND 

396
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,488
OF BUSINESS THAT HAS A MOAT, 

397
00:22:35,186 --> 00:22:39,690
IT'S A COMMODITY BUSINESS.

398
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:41,726
THEY OWN A LOT OF REALLY GOOD, 

399
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:44,128
HIGH QUALITY INSURANCE NAMES.

400
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:46,364
THEY DO ALSO INVEST IN A LOT OF 

401
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:50,635
BUSINESSES THAT ARE INTANGIBLE 

402
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:53,104
ASSETS, ONE OF THE MOAT SOURCES.

403
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,571
THEY OWN THINGS LIKE J&J MERCK, 

404
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,907
BRISTOL-MYERS.

405
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:57,275
APPLE AND COKE WITH THEIR STRONG

406
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:59,911
BRAND LOYALTY.

407
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,979
THOSE ARE ALSO EXAMPLES OF 

408
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,747
INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

409
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,148
THEY ALSO HAVE THINGS LIKE 

410
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:06,217
RAILROADS, PIPE LINES THAT 

411
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:07,852
BENEFIT FROM EFFICIENT SCALE.

412
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:09,787
THERE MIGHT ONLY BE ONE PROVIDER

413
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,024

414
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:14,625

COMPANIES.

418
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:23,334
THERE'S ALSO A NETWORK, EFFECT.

LOOP OF MERCHANTS, CARDHOLDERS.

A LOT OF PEOPLE USING THE 

422
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:30,775

423
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:32,310
PEOPLE AS MORE PEOPLE USE IT.

424
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:35,179
SWITCHING COSTS.

425
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:37,648
LIKE WHEN IT WOULD BECOME MORE 

426
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:40,618

JOINING US NOW IS WILLIAM GREEN,

478
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:40,825
AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK "RICHER,

WORLD'S INVESTORS WIN IN THE

MARKETS AND LIFE."

482
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:48,833
ONE OF THE INVESTORS YOU DID 

483
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:49,066
SPEAK TO FOR THIS BOOK, CHARLIE 

484
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,701
MUNGER.

485
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:52,203
I WONDER IF WE START WITH THE 

486
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:55,439
BIG TAKE AWAY FROM YOU.

487
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,473
WHAT YOU TOOK AWAY FROM YOUR 

488
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:59,110
CONVERSATION WITH HIM IN TERMS 

489
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,512
OF THE KEY TO BUILDING WEALTH. 

490
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:03,014
>> TO ME, ONE OF THE MOST 

491
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:05,616
FASCINATING THINGS ABOUT CHARLIE

492
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:06,884
MUNGER, YOU HAVE ONE OF THE 

493
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:09,420
GREATEST GUYS ALIVE.

494
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:11,589
HE CAN SEE THE ESSENCE OF WHAT 

495
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,823
ANY SUBJECT IS ABOUT BEFORE 

496
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:14,058
YOU'VE EVEN FINISHED THE 

497
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,860
SENTENCE AND YET WHAT CHARLIE 

498
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,295
DOES THAT I THINK IS 

499
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,464
EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL FOR ANY 

500
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:23,167
OF US, BOTH IN INVESTING AND 

501
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:24,568
LIFE, IS HE FOCUSES ON REDUCING 

502
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,837
STANDARD STUPIDITIES.

503
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:31,042
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SUCCEED, 

504
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:39,783
BOTH AS AN INVESTOR AND IN LIFE,

505
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:40,084
YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON BEING N

506
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,819
NON-IDIOTIC.

507
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,887
HE COLLECTS ABSURD, DUMB, 

508
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,756
FOOLISH THINGS PEOPLE DO AND 

509
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,690
THEN HE ASKS HIMSELF, WELL, WHAT

510
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,025
CAUSED THOSE THINGS?

511
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:49,594
WHAT CAUSED THIS DISASTER?

512
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:50,728
THEN HE SAYS, LET ME FOCUS ON 

513
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,695
NOT DOING THAT.

514
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:54,031
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS AS A 

515
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:56,300
TAKE AWAY FOR ANY INVESTOR, 

516
00:28:54,098 --> 00:28:58,770
THINK ABOUT THE WAYS MOST OF US 

517
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,370
MESS UP AS INVESTORS.

518
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,838
WE'RE IMPATIENT.

519
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,807
WE TRY TO TIME THE MARKET.

520
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,107
WE SPECULATE ON THINGS WE DON'T 

521
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,976
UNDERSTAND.

522
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:06,477
WE TRADE IN AND OUT.

523
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:08,112
WE'RE MUCH TOO EMOTIONAL.

524
00:29:06,543 --> 00:29:10,248
WE GET CAUGHT UP IN FACTS.

525
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:12,383
HERE YOU HAVE CHARLIE AND WARREN

526
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:15,253
BASICALLY JUST AVOIDING ALL OF 

527
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,221
THOSE STANDARD STUPIDITIES.

528
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,589
IT'S ACTUALLY EASIER TO AVOID 

529
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,925
BEING STUPID THAN TO BE SMART.

530
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:22,426
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A WONDERFUL 

531
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,494
PARADOX THAT YOU HAVE THE 

532
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:26,964
SMARTEST GIA LIVE JUST TRYING TO

533
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,667
BE SYSTEMATICALLY LESS STUPID.

534
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:30,968
>> WILLIAM, I WANT TO FOLLOW-UP 

535
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:33,304
ON THAT POINT.

536
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:35,106
WHEN CHARLIE AND WARREN TALK, IT

537
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:37,241
SOUNDS SO EASY AND YOU LISTEN TO

538
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:39,376
IT AND YOU GO, YUP, I'M GOING TO

539
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:41,445
DO THAT, I'M GOING TO DO THAT, 

540
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:43,347
I'M GOING TO DO THAT AND THEN 

541
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:43,614
YOU TRY TO DO IT, YOU CAN'T DO 

542
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,684
IT.

543
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:48,619
WHY IS THERE THIS GAP?

544
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:51,255
>> CHARLIE ALWAYS SAYS ABOUT 

545
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,455
INVESTING, IT'S SIMPLE, NOT 

546
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:52,857
EASY.

547
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:54,325
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO 

548
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,993
UNDERSTAND, YOU HAVE TO START BY

549
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,395
SAYING, WELL, THERE ARE THESE 

550
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,297
PRINCIPLES BE THAT I NEED TO 

551
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,097
UNDERSTAND ABOUT HOW INVESTING 

552
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:02,100
WORKS.

553
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:03,134
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WANT TO 

554
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:05,069
BE PATIENT.

555
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,470
YOU WANT TO BUY ASSETS WHEN 

556
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,105
THEY'RE WORTH CONSIDERABLY MORE 

557
00:30:06,537 --> 00:30:08,305
THAN THE MARKET THINKS THEY'RE 

558
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:10,641
WORTH.

559
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:10,841
SO THERE'S A MARGIN OF SAFETY 

560
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,109
THERE.

561
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:13,377
THEN THINK ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY 

562
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:15,746
OF ACTUALLY BUYING THINGS THAT 

563
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:17,982
ARE UNPOPULAR, THAT EVERYONE 

564
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:20,651
ELSE THINKS ARE UNDER VALUED -- 

565
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,986
THAT EVERYONE ELSE THINKS ARE 

566
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,653
ACTUALLY CHEAP BECAUSE THEY 

567
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:25,222
DESERVE TO BE CHEAP.

568
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,290
I THINK THERE'S A TREMENDOUS 

569
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:27,825
PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE.

570
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:30,127
WHEN I LOOK AT CHARLIE AND 

571
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,529
WARREN, I THINK ONE OF THEIR 

572
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:34,065
GREATEST ADVANTAGES IS JUST THAT

573
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,699
THEY'RE ENTIRELY UNEMOTIONAL.

574
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:37,068
THEY'RE NOT REALLY SUCKED UP BY 

575
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:38,469
THE EMOTIONS OF THE CROWD.

576
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:40,137
WHEN I WENT TO INTERVIEW CHARLIE

577
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:42,106
I SAID TO HIM DURING THE MARKET 

578
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:43,974
CRASH IN 2009 WHEN YOU WERE 

579
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:46,543
BUYING THINGS LIKE WELLS FARGO 

580
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:48,612
AT THE BOTTOM TICK OF THE CRASH 

581
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,983
IN MARCH 2009, DID YOU FEEL 

582
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,350
THESE EMOTIONS, LIKE FEAR, 

583
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,418
ANXIETY, WORRY?

584
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,152
HE SAID, NO, I JUST DIDN'T FEEL 

585
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,187
THEM AT ALL.

586
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:59,356
I SAID, DOES WARREN FEEL IT?

587
00:30:57,254 --> 00:31:00,157
HE SAID, NO, HE'S WIRED EXACTLY 

588
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:05,896
THE SAME WAY.

589
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:07,765
SO I THINK THERE'S A TREMENDOUS 

590
00:31:05,963 --> 00:31:13,170
TEMPERAMENTAL ADVANTAGE, WHICH 

591
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:15,406
IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL THEM 

592
00:31:13,237 --> 00:31:17,241
AND EVERYONE IS SAYING, I CAN'T 

593
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:19,110
BELIEVE THEY HAVE $145 BILLION 

594
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,211
IN CASH AND THEY'RE NOT DOING 

595
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,178
ANYTHING, WHY DON'T THEY DO 

596
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,314
SOMETHING?

597
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:24,482
THEY'RE JUST SUBLIMELY 

598
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,549
INDIFFERENT TO THE CRIES FROM 

599
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,385
THE CROWD.

600
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:28,719
WARREN JUST SAID, WE'RE NOT PAID

601
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,520
FOR ACTIVITY, WE'RE PAID FOR 

602
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:32,022
BEING RIGHT.

603
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:33,657
>> AND YET TO ANDY'S POINT, 

604
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:35,426
EASIER SAID THAN DONE, TO BREAK 

605
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:36,460
AWAY FROM ALL THE NOISE THAT'S 

606
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,629
OUT THERE.

607
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:39,997
THE PRINCIPLE -- THE GUIDING 

608
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,899
PRINCIPLES WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT 

609
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:45,102
WARREN BUFFETT AND CHARLIE 

610
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:45,436
MUNGER, EXTREME PATIENCE AND 

611
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,371
SELECTIVENESS.

612
00:31:45,502 --> 00:31:49,674
HOW DO INVESTORS AT HOME APPLY 

613
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:53,077
THAT THOUGH TO THEIR PORTFOLIO?

614
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:54,278
>> CHARLIE HAS THIS BEAUTIFUL 

615
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,545
IMAGE THAT I TAKE VERY 

616
00:31:54,344 --> 00:31:57,014
SERIOUSLY.

617
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:58,783
HE SAYS, YOU SHOULD BE LIKE A 

618
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,451
SPEAR FISHERMAN.

619
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,652
YOU SHOULD BE STANDING BY THE 

620
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:04,155
SIDE OF THE STREAM MOST OF THE 

621
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:08,492
TIME DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

622
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:10,361
ONCE IN A WHILE A FAT, JUICY 

623
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,528
SALMON COMES BY AND YOU SPEAR 

624
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,963
IT.

625
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:14,765
THEN IT MAY BE FOR THE NEXT SIX 

626
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:21,705
MONTHS NOTHING COMES ALONG.

627
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:22,940
ONE OF THE GREAT TAKE AWAYS IS 

628
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:24,842
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HELP YOU.

629
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,276
IF PRICE IS BEING PRICED IN A 

630
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,678
WAY THAT IS NOT PARTICULARLY 

631
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:29,246
ATTRACTIVE WHICH IS GENERALLY 

632
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:31,015
SPEAKING THE CASE AT THE MOMENT,

633
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:31,615
YOU WANT TO TREAD WITH EXTREME 

634
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:33,384
CAUTION.

635
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:34,118
THEN AT THE MOMENTS WHERE 

636
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,586
SUDDENLY THE BIPARTISAN MARKET 

637
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:39,923
GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION, IS 

638
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:42,793
GOING NUTS, IS PRESENTING YOU 

639
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:44,094
WITH LOTS OF FAT, JUICY SALMONS,

640
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,863
THAT'S WHEN YOU WANT TO STRIKE 

641
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:46,197
WITH WHAT CHARLIE CALLS 

642
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,666
GUMPTION.

643
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,966
SET YOURSELF UP COUNTER 

644
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,834
CULTURALLY.

645
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:53,104
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS 

646
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:55,072
HYPERACTIVE SAYING I MUST DO 

647
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,907
SOMETHING, BITCOIN IS SURGING, 

648
00:32:55,139 --> 00:33:00,444
TESLA IS SURGING, I MUST ACT.

649
00:32:56,974 --> 00:33:01,946
HERE ARE CHARLIE AND WARREN 

650
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:04,081
ACTING CALMLY.

651
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:07,417
SPEAR FISHERMEN, HAPPY TO WAIT 

652
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:08,819
BY THE STREAM, FISH AND TWIDDLE 

653
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:11,055
THEIR THUMBS.

654
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:13,691
THEY'VE SET THEIR LINES UP IN A 

655
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:15,259
WAY AS HEROICALLY INACTIVE.

656
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,994
THEY'RE PLAYING BRIDGE, READING 

657
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,429
FOR HOURS A DAY, THEY'RE 

658
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,664
FISHING, GOLFING, CHATTING WITH 

659
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:23,034
FRIENDS AND JUST READING TONS OF

660
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:23,334
ANNUAL REPORTS AND TONS OF 

661
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,968
BIOGRAPHIES.

662
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:26,971
SO I THINK YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY 

663
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:29,206
TRY TO STRUCTURE A LIFE IN A WAY

664
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:32,677
THAT ENABLES YOU TO BE MUCH MORE

665
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:35,012
PATIENT SO THAT YOU'RE NOT 

666
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:35,913
GETTING SUCKED INTO THE HYPER 

667
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,648
ACTIVITY OF THE MARKET. 

668
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,785
>> I LIKE THAT IMAGE THAT YOU 

669
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:42,086
JUST PUT OUT THERE, WILLIAM, TWO

670
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,887
FISHERMEN SPEAR FISHING ON THE 

671
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,121
SIDE OF THE RIVER.

672
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,456
BUT YOU TALK ABOUT THE TWO OF 

673
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,491
THEM TOGETHER, HOW IMPORTANT IS 

674
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,259
THAT PARTNERSHIP, DO YOU THINK?

675
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:51,062
JULIA LaROCHE IS TALKING ABOUT 

676
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:53,397
THEM BEING REUNITED THIS YEAR.

677
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:56,500
HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT TO ACHIEVE

678
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:59,303
INVESTING RESULTS, TO HAVE 

679
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:06,010
SOMEONE TO BOUNCE SOMETHING OFF 

680
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:06,610
OF LIKE THAT.

681
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,612
CHARLIE TALKS ABOUT HAPPENING 

682
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:10,347
OUT WITH THE EMINENT DEAD.

683
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,981
ONE THAT HE HANGS OUT WITH IS 

684
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:12,382
DARWIN.

685
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,318
WHAT HE LEARNED FROM DARWIN IS 

686
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,585
DARWIN WAS SEEKING DISCONFIRMING

687
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,887
EVIDENCE.

688
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:18,489
HE WASN'T TRYING TO SUPPORT HIS 

689
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,457
RELIGIOUS VIEWS WITH HIS 

690
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,592
INVESTIGATIONS INTO EVOLUTION.

691
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:23,694
HE WAS TRYING TO DESTROY HIS OWN

692
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,028
MOST CHERISHED BELIEFS IN A 

693
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,397
SENSE.

694
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,531
I THINK PART OF WHAT THIS 

695
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,233
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHARLIE AND

696
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:31,368
WARREN ENABLES THEM TO DO IS TO 

697
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,837
TEST EACH OTHER'S BELIEFS.

698
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:36,707
WARREN FAMOUSLY HAS DESCRIBED 

699
00:34:33,904 --> 00:34:37,975
CHARLIE AS THE A BOMB MIN NABL 

700
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,510
NO MAN.

701
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:41,011
TO HAVE THIS MECHANISM, 

702
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,648
STRUCTURE WHERE SOMEBODY IS 

703
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:44,314
CHALLENGING YOUR BELIEFS AND IS 

704
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:48,185
SMART ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO 

705
00:34:44,381 --> 00:34:50,121
CHALLENGE YOU, I THINK THAT'S 

706
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:54,625
HUGELY POWERFUL.

707
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,925
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT 

708
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,027
OPPORTUNITY.

709
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:58,729
WE CAN BE CONSTANTLY SEARCHING 

710
00:34:57,094 --> 00:35:01,698
FOR DISCONFIRMING INFORMATION.

711
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:04,868
IF YOU'RE POLITICALLY LIBERAL 

712
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:06,470
YOU READ "THE WALL STREET 

713
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:09,340
JOURNAL" OP ED PAGE.

714
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,840
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CHARLIE 

715
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:11,342
VERY CONSCIOUSLY DOES.

716
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,010
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT 

717
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,645
YOU HAVE WARREN AS A DEMOCRAT, 

718
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:16,647
CHARLIE AS A REPUBLICAN, THEY'VE

719
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,781
HAD THIS KIND OF WONDERFUL 

720
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,083
RELATIONSHIP WHERE THEY'RE 

721
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:20,251
ACTUALLY SEEKING OUT VIEWS THAT 

722
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,085
ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEIR OWN AND

723
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,987
THEN AT THE SAME TIME I THINK 

724
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:28,392
TREATING EACH OTHER WITH 

725
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:30,227
TREMENDOUS DECENCY AND KINDNESS.

726
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,428
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE 

727
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,664
ALL EXCITED ABOUT.

728
00:35:31,495 --> 00:35:34,331
IT'S IN A SENSE THE REUNION OF 

729
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,400
THIS ODD COUPLE.

730
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:39,436
ON THE OCCASIONS THAT I'VE BEEN 

731
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:40,871
TO OMAHA FOR THE BERKSHIRE 

732
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:42,472
MEETING, ONE OF THE MOST JOYOUS 

733
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,974
AND MEMORABLE THINGS, IT'S 

734
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,143
ALMOST LIKE A COMEDY ACT.

735
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:50,447
IT'S AS IF YOU'RE WATCHING 

736
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:51,649
WALTER MATTOW AND JACK LEMON 

737
00:35:50,514 --> 00:35:53,350
WISE CRACKING TOGETHER.

738
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:58,422
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT 

739
00:35:53,417 --> 00:36:03,394
PARTNERSHIP AND THEN THE FACT 

740
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:04,861
THEY TREAT THEM.

741
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,430
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE'VE 

742
00:36:04,928 --> 00:36:08,966
ALL BEEN COMING BACK YEAR AFTER 

743
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,501
YEAR AND WHY WE'RE ALL HAPPY TO 

744
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:12,903
SEE CHARLIE BACK THIS YEAR AFTER

745
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:15,906
BEING ABSENT LAST YEAR.

746
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:17,942
>> WILLIAM GREENE, AUTHOR OF 

747
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:19,443
"RICHER, WEISER, HAPPIER."

748
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:21,645
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

749
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,180
I SHOULD MENTION WARREN BUFFETT 

750
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,615
HAS JUST COME INTO THE ROOM.

751
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,684
THEY'RE DOING SOME TESTS HERE.

752
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,719
WE'RE HALF AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE

753
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,487
BEGINNING OF THE ANNUAL MEETING.

754
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,689
IN THE MEANTIME, I WANT TO TALK 

755
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:34,391
ABOUT CHOCOLATE.

756
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:36,527
IT IS THE ULTIMATE COMFORT FOOD.

757
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:38,462
SALES OF CHOCOLATE WAY, WAY UP.

758
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,564
CANDY SALES HIT A RECORD $44 

759
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:45,302
BILLION LAST YEAR.

760
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:46,504
THAT'S GREAT FOR C'S CANDIES AND

761
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,139
THE CEO PAT EGAN JOINS US NEXT 

762
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,139

00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,739
>>> I'M PLEASED TO BRING TO YOU 

764
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:05,008
ALL THIS CONVERSATION WITH ONE 

765
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:11,515
OF OUR VERY FAVORITE BOOTHS AT 

766
00:39:05,075 --> 00:39:11,748
THE BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ANNUAL 

767
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:15,352
MEETING.

768
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:17,454
THAT IS SEE'S CANDY.

769
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,821
PAT, SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU JOIN 

770
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,089
US.

771
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,392
100th ANNIVERSARY.

772
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:23,794
I WISH WE COULD BE IN PERSON.

773
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,994
>> I WISH I COULD BE THERE TOO, 

774
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,928
JULIA.

775
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,229
THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

776
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,631
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO NEXT 

777
00:39:26,296 --> 00:39:29,266
YEAR COMING BACK.

778
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,566
OMAHA IS ALWAYS A BIG DEAL FOR 

779
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,268
US.

780
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,336
WE'RE GOING TO MISS IT.

781
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,536
HOPEFULLY WE'RE BACK THERE NEXT 

782
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,770
YEAR. 

783
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,538
>> CERTAINLY HOPE WE'RE BACK 

784
00:39:33,837 --> 00:39:37,274
NEXT YEAR.

785
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:40,444
WE'RE SO USED TO SEEING TONS OF 

786
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:43,046
CANDY AT THAT BOOTH IN OMAHA.

787
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:44,014
I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS ARE 

788
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:45,182
INTERESTED, PAT.

789
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,916
HOW HAS BUSINESS BEEN FOR YOU 

790
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:48,118
ALL IN THE LAST YEAR?

791
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:49,453
>> WELL, I LIKE TO SAY THE LAST 

792
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,354
YEAR'S BEEN THE LONGEST DECADE 

793
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,922
OF MY LIFE.

794
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:54,057
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

795
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,225
LAST YEAR IT'S A TALE OF A 

796
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:56,994
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT QUARTERS.

797
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:57,294
THE FIRST QUARTER WAS 

798
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,929
TREMENDOUS.

799
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,897
WE STARTED OFF REALLY HOT AT THE

800
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:02,533
BEGINNING OF 2020 AND WE ENDED 

801
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:04,368
PRETTY GOOD.

802
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,669
THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS WE

803
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:07,471
ESSENTIALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF 

804
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,306
MARCH WHEN THIS FIRST REALLY 

805
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:11,141
HIT, WE SHUT DOWN ALL OF OUR 

806
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:14,011
STORES IN THE SPAN OF FIVE DAYS.

807
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:15,745
SO ABOUT 245 STORES WE CLOSED IN

808
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,414
A MATTER OF DAYS AND THEN ABOUT 

809
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:19,950
A WEEK AND A HALF LATER WE 

810
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:21,552
CLOSED OUR eCOMMERCE FULFILLMENT

811
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,852
CENTER DOWN IN SOUTHERN 

812
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,921
CALIFORNIA.

813
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:26,089
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THERE WE 

814
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:30,560
ESSENTIALLY COMPLETELY STOPPED 

815
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:32,029
AND THE REASON FOR IT WAS WE 

816
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:33,297
OPERATE AND ARE HEADQUARTERED IN

817
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:35,299
THE BAY AREA.

818
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,733
THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ORDERS

819
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,767
ISSUED NATIONALLY.

820
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:39,569
AND SO WE RESPECTED AND STOPPED 

821
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:41,805
AND THEN WE JUST -- WE WENT 

822
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:43,473
THROUGH ALL OF THE STATES THAT 

823
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,208
WERE SUCCESSIVELY THAT WEEK 

824
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,675
SHUTTING DOWN.

825
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,477
SO FROM THAT POINT FORWARD WHAT 

826
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:49,679
WE DID WAS WE JUST SAID WE'RE 

827
00:40:47,544 --> 00:40:51,381
NOT GOING TO REOPEN STORES OR 

828
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:53,216
REOPEN OUR PLANTS UNTIL WE CAN 

829
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:54,885
CREATE A SAFE OPERATING 

830
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:55,152
ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL OF OUR 

831
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,920
EMPLOYEES.

832
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,522
THAT TOOK A WHILE AND BY THE 

833
00:40:56,987 --> 00:41:00,790
TIME WE RESTORED AT THE END OF 

834
00:40:58,588 --> 00:41:02,225
THE SUMMER WE SAW CUSTOMERS 

835
00:41:00,857 --> 00:41:05,562
COMING BACK IN, BUT FOR THAT 

836
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:05,795
PERIOD OF TIME, IT WAS PRETTY 

837
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,364
ROUGH. 

838
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:08,832
>> HOW ABOUT RIGHT NOW, HOW ARE 

839
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:11,401
THINGS FOR YOU ALL?

840
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:13,703
HOW ARE YOUR STORE REOPENINGS?

841
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:16,072
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE PROBABLY DOING 

842
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:19,577
A LOT OF BUSINESS ONLINE.

843
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:21,678
I KNOW AROUND VALENTINE'S DAY I 

844
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,247
WAS LOOKING TO ORDER CANDIES FOR

845
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,580
SOME OF THE SPECIAL FOLKS IN MY 

846
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,982
LIFE.

847
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,817
HOW ARE THINGS NOW?

848
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,217
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS, 

849
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,051
JULIE.

850
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,753
IT'S GREAT.

851
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:31,421
WE'RE FULLY BACK, I BELIEVE.

852
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,656
WE'VE HAD OUR BEST JANUARY EVER,

853
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:35,359
OUR BEST FEBRUARY EVER.

854
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:35,893
WE JUST COMPLETED OUR BEST FIRST

855
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:38,562
QUARTER EVER.

856
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,997
AS YOU MENTIONED eCOMMERCE, WE 

857
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:43,633
HAD A GREAT GROWTH LAST YEAR.

858
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:44,768
WE GREW 70% JUST IN LOOKING AT 

859
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,336
TOTAL PACKAGES SHIPPED.

860
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,571
WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT WOULD BE 

861
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,872
THAT WHEN THE STORES REOPENED, 

862
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,406
THAT THAT WOULD TRAIL OFF A 

863
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,441
LITTLE BIT.

864
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:54,144
IT HASN'T.

865
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:55,679
OUR FIRST QUARTER WE WERE UP 

866
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,246
160% OVER THE FIRST QUARTER OF 

867
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,415
LAST YEAR.

868
00:41:56,313 --> 00:42:00,117
SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THE 

869
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:01,851
TRAFFIC COMING BACK INTO STORES.

870
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,620
IT'S BEEN GRADUAL, BUT WE'RE 

871
00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:05,188
ALMOST BACK TO 100%.

872
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,290
OUR eCOMMERCE, WHICH HAS MORE 

873
00:42:05,255 --> 00:42:08,625
THAN DOUBLED, HAS ACTUALLY 

874
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:10,393
STAYED AT THAT LEVEL.

875
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,662
WE'RE JUST FINE WITH IT NOT 

876
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,764
COMING BACK TO EARTH.

877
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:16,066
IT CREATES DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL

878
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:17,334
CHALLENGES BUT WE'VE DEFINITELY 

879
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:22,306
EXPANDED OUR CUSTOMER BASE. 

880
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:24,074
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S VERY

881
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,809
INTERESTING ABOUT SEE'S, THE 

882
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:27,978
CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE STORES.

883
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,312
PAT, YOU COME FROM AN ENERGY 

884
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,713
BACKGROUND.

885
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:32,349
THE LAST TIME WE TALKED TO YOU 

886
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,050
WAS AT THE ANNUAL MEETING IN 

887
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,451
2019.

888
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,753
YOU WERE A FEW DAYS ON THE JOB, 

889
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,121
A COUPLE OF YEARS ON THE JOB.

890
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,990
COMING INTO RETAIL, WHAT HAS 

891
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:42,192
BEEN THE BIGGEST TAKE AWAYS FOR 

892
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,293
YOU, SOME OF YOUR BIGGEST 

893
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,994
LEARNINGS IN YOUR ROLE?

894
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,828
>> YEAH.

895
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,497
A COUPLE OF THINGS.

896
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,432
AS YOU MENTIONED, OUR FOCUS ON 

897
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:52,636
CUSTOMER SERVICE.

898
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:54,504
I FEEL SO FORTUNATE, I PINCH 

899
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,472
MYSELF THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE 

900
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:56,406
TREMENDOUS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE 

901
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,475
IS AMAZING.

902
00:42:56,472 --> 00:42:59,643
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN 

903
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,111
CUSTOMERS COME INTO OUR STORE, 

904
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,679
THAT THEY LEAVE WITH A SMILE AND

905
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,413
THAT THEY'RE HAPPIER THAN WHEN 

906
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,616
THEY STARTED.

907
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,317
I LIKE TO SAY, WE SELL JOY.

908
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,951
 MY BACKGROUND IN ENERGY IS A 

909
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:09,186
LITTLE DIFFERENT.

910
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:11,255
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

911
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,656
BUT I LEARNED SO MANY GOOD 

912
00:43:11,321 --> 00:43:14,224
LESSONS THERE THAT I HOPE HAVE 

913
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:17,060
SERVED US WELL HERE, AND THAT IS

914
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:18,495
THAT IT'S NOT EASY TO MAKE AN 

915
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,762
ENERGY CUSTOMER HAPPY ALL THE 

916
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,097
TIME.

917
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:22,265
WHEN YOU'RE INTERACTING WITH 

918
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:24,334
THEM, IT'S USUALLY ABOUT A BILL 

919
00:43:22,332 --> 00:43:25,669
OR YOU'VE HAD AN OUTAGE.

920
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,203
WE TRY TO MAKE BOTH OF THOSE 

921
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:29,206
THINGS AS MINIMAL AS POSSIBLE, 

922
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:32,042
BUT I REALLY WORK VERY HARD WITH

923
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:33,677
A GREAT TEAM THERE TO FOCUS ON 

924
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,379
WHAT DOES THE CUSTOMER NEED?

925
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,546
I WILL SAY THAT IS THE BERKSHIRE

926
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,813
WAY.

927
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:38,748
THAT'S PART OF WHAT I'M PROUD 

928
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,485
ABOUT AND I CAN SEE THE 

929
00:43:38,815 --> 00:43:42,753
TRANSITION FROM ENERGY INTO 

930
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:45,922
CANDY, THE COMMON THREAD IS THAT

931
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,924
WE TAKE CARE OF OUR CUSTOMERS 

932
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:50,127
AND SEE'S HAS DONE IT FOR A 

933
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:50,327
CENTURY AND DONE IT TREMENDOUSLY

934
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,396
WELL. 

935
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:54,330
>> WARREN BUFFETT'S MANAGEMENT 

936
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,331
STYLE, THE HANDS OFF MANAGEMENT 

937
00:43:54,397 --> 00:43:56,099
STYLE FOR THE DIFFERENT 

938
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:58,235
PORTFOLIO COMPANIES.

939
00:43:56,166 --> 00:44:00,070
I IMAGINE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT 

940
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,371
BUFFETT, HE OFTEN TALKS ABOUT 

941
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,073
WANTING TO BE REMEMBERED AS A 

942
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:05,408
TEACHER, WHAT'S BEEN THE MOST 

943
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,376
IMPORTANT LESSON YOU'VE LEARNED 

944
00:44:05,475 --> 00:44:08,679
FROM WARREN?

945
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:11,348
>> INTEGRITY.

946
00:44:08,745 --> 00:44:13,049
I REGULARLY REVIEW HIS QUOTES.

947
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:15,318
HE'S VERY -- YOU'RE RIGHT, HE'S 

948
00:44:13,116 --> 00:44:16,920
HANDS OFF, BUT HE'S VERY 

949
00:44:15,385 --> 00:44:18,388
EFFICIENT AND VERY EFFECTIVE IN 

950
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,223
CONVEYING THE MESSAGE, WHICH IS 

951
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:21,258
DO THE RIGHT THING.

952
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,959
TAKE CARE OF THE CUSTOMER.

953
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:23,894
TAKE CARE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES AND 

954
00:44:23,026 --> 00:44:27,163
THE RESULTS WILL FOLLOW.

955
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:28,865
AND I HAD THE GREAT FORTUNE OF 

956
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,633
WORKING WITH GREG ABEL IN THE 

957
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:32,436
ENERGY BUSINESS.

958
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,636
HE IS VERY MUCH A DEVOTEE OF 

959
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,870
THAT.

960
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:36,039
JUST LIVING UP TO THAT AND 

961
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:37,340
MAKING SURE THAT WE FOLLOW 

962
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:38,442
THROUGH ON THOSE PRINCIPLES IS 

963
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:40,677
FIRST AND FOREMOST.

964
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,879
AND, YOU KNOW, AS A TEACHER, HE 

965
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:45,015
LEADS BY EXAMPLE ALL THE TIME.

966
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:46,616
HE'S VERY FOCUSED ON GETTING THE

RIGHT OUTCOMES CERTAINLY FOR OUR

CUSTOMERS.

969
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:51,221
I THINK HE'S A GREAT CITIZEN OF

00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,556
THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD AND A 

971
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:54,224

00:48:23,466 --> 00:48:24,868
THIS TIME OF YEAR. 

1010
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,536
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1011
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:28,939
THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

1012
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:30,473
LET'S JUMP OFF AT THIS POINT.

1013
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,942
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THIS 

1014
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,242
YEAR THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM PRIOR

1015
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,711
YEARS.

1016
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:36,179
WE HAVE A DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHY. 

1017
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,948
>> LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I'M 

1018
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,915
LOOKING FOR THAT'S THE SAME, THE

1019
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:41,385
CHARLIE AND WARREN SHOW.

1020
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:44,621
TO ME, IT'S IRREPLACEABLE AND IT

1021
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:45,255
IS THE DELIGHT AND MOST 

1022
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:48,991
MEANINGFUL PART OF THE MEETING.

1023
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:51,494
IN ADDITION, YOU KNOW, IT'S NICE

1024
00:48:49,058 --> 00:48:53,263
TO HAVE AN EXCUSE TO BE IN 

1025
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,630
OMAHA -- I MEAN, BE IN LOS 

1026
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,898
ANGELES.

1027
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:59,002
I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO RETURNING

1028
00:48:54,964 --> 00:49:01,304
TO OMAHA NEXT YEAR.

1029
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:03,106
HAVING ALL THE PEOPLE AROUND AND

1030
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:05,041
THE FUN THAT WE DO, THESE 

1031
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:06,309
VIRTUAL THINGS ARE A GOOD 

1032
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,843
SUBSTITUTE BUT NOT AS MUCH FUN. 

1033
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:09,379
>> RIGHT.

1034
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,813
SO THIS YEAR IS A BIT OF A 

1035
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,913
HYBRID.

1036
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,247
NO SHAREHOLDERS, BUT WE DO 

1037
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,583
HAVE -- 

1038
00:49:11,314 --> 00:49:13,917
>> WELL, A FEW OF US ARE 

1039
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:14,284
SHAREHOLDERS. 

1040
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,053
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1041
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:18,121
THE DIRECTORS ARE SHAREHOLDERS.

1042
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,455
BASICALLY THIS ROOM RIGHT HERE 

1043
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,223
IS GOING TO HAVE THE DIRECTORS 

1044
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:21,558
IN IT.

1045
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,259
YOU CAN SEE THE STAGE, AS IT 

1046
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:26,329
WERE, IS UP THERE WHERE WARREN 

1047
00:49:23,326 --> 00:49:27,563
AND CHARLIE AND I CAN SEE GREG 

1048
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:29,599
ABEL IS ALREADY UP THERE. 

1049
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:32,068
>> GREG IS THERE, AJIT WILL BE 

1050
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:33,503
THERE AND WARREN AND CHARLIE.

1051
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,971
THEY'VE GOT A BANK OF CAMERAS IN

1052
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,906
FRONT OF THEM AND THERE'S A 

1053
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:40,343
PLACE WHERE BECKY QUICK'S GOING 

1054
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:44,080
TO BE SITTING OFF SCREEN 

1055
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:47,917
PROBABLY BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- 

1056
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:51,788
IT'S I THINK WORKED OUT VERY, 

1057
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:53,156
VERY WELL.

1058
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,756
THE COMPANY JUST ANNOUNCED 

1059
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,024
EARNINGS THIS MORNING.

1060
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:57,894
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THOSE AND 

1061
00:49:55,091 --> 00:49:59,029
WHERE IS THE COMPANY GOING?

1062
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,663
>> UP.

1063
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:03,066
THE BIG COMPANIES THAT WARREN 

1064
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:05,668
FEATURES IN HIS LETTER EACH 

1065
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:07,437
YEAR, YOU KNOW, ENERGY COMPANY, 

1066
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:10,106
INSURANCE BUSINESSES AND SO ON, 

1067
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:13,410
I MEAN, THEY'RE DOING 

1068
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:14,811
SENSATIONAL, JUST SENSATIONAL.

1069
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:17,914
WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE 

1070
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:18,214
THAT THAT CLIMB IS GOING TO 

1071
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:19,549
CONTINUE.

1072
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:21,384
BY AND LARGE INSURANCE 

1073
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:23,954
THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC PERIOD 

1074
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:27,256
HAS DONE VERY, VERY WELL.

1075
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:29,926
AND SO DID THE ENERGY BUSINESS 

1076
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:30,326
AND BNSF, THEY HELD UP VERY 

1077
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:33,529
WELL.

1078
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:35,531
SOME OF THE RETAIL BUSINESSES, 

1079
00:50:33,596 --> 00:50:38,501
YOU KNOW, THEY WERE VERY 

1080
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:38,902
SERIOUSLY HURT DURING THE 

1081
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:42,572
PANDEMIC.

1082
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:44,774
AND THOSE THAT HAD A LOT 

1083
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:47,010
INVESTED IN THE MALL ACCESS, I 

1084
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:50,079
THINK PARTICULARLY SO.

1085
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:52,248
AND SO THOSE ARE CLIMBING BUT 

1086
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:52,882
NOT -- YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT OUT

1087
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,851
OF THE HOLE.

1088
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:57,053
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG HAUL, I 

1089
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:58,788
THINK, FOR SOME OF THE 

1090
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,523
BUSINESSES, BUT BY AND LARGE 

1091
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:02,725
WE'RE -- I'M VERY, VERY PLEASED 

1092
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,460
WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING.

1093
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:06,763
>> WHAT IS IT LIKE BEING A 

1094
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:08,198
DIRECTOR OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY?

1095
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,999
HOW OFTEN DO YOU TALK?

1096
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:11,201
HOW OFTEN DOES WARREN BUFFETT 

1097
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,802
TALK TO YOU GUYS?

1098
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,837
WHAT IS THE COMMUNICATION LIKE?

1099
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,237
WHAT'S IT LIKE BEHIND THE 

1100
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:20,677
SCENES?

1101
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:24,614
>> WELL, WE HAVE BASICALLY TWO 

1102
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:27,383
BIG IN-PERSON MEETINGS A YEAR 

1103
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:29,719
AND THEN A NUMBER OF OTHER 

1104
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:31,954
DIRECTOR MEETINGS DURING THE 

1105
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:33,690
COURSE OF THE YEAR OFTEN 

1106
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:34,958
DEPENDING UPON PARTICULAR 

1107
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,558
CIRCUMSTANCES, AN ACQUISITION OR

1108
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,861
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1109
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:40,697
IN ADDITION TO THAT, I THINK YOU

1110
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,866
KNOW, WARREN'S A COMMUNICATOR.

1111
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,601
CHARLIE'S A COMMUNICATOR AND, OF

1112
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,369
COURSE, WITH CHARLIE, HE'S IN 

1113
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,870
LOS ANGELES AND HE AND I TALK 

1114
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,339
OFTEN.

1115
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:52,341
WARREN AND I TEND TO TALK ON 

1116
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:56,045
SUNDAYS, AND HE DOES THAT WITH 

1117
00:51:52,408 --> 00:51:56,479
OTHER DIRECTORS THROUGHOUT THE 

1118
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:58,314
YEAR.

1119
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:59,516
HE'S ON THE PHONE WITH THE 

1120
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:01,651
MANAGERS ALL THE TIME.

1121
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:04,354
I MEAN -- SO THERE'S A LOT OF 

1122
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:06,222
COMMUNICATION IN THIS COMPANY.

1123
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:06,589
COMMUNICATION UP, COMMUNICATION 

1124
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,491
DOWN.

1125
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:10,360
A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY.

1126
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:11,761
>> SUNDAYS, HUH?

1127
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,663
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE WORKING 

1128
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:15,264
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK HERE?

1129
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,799
>> ANY TIME YOU'RE TALKING TO 

1130
00:52:15,331 --> 00:52:17,167
WARREN YOU'RE HAVING FUN.

1131
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:20,469
>> RIGHT.

1132
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:22,138
WE TALKED ABOUT AJIT JAIN AND 

1133
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:23,873
GREG ABEL UP THERE ON THE STAGE.

1134
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,173
HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

1135
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,074
SUCCESSION.

1136
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,543
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK YOU ABOUT 

1137
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,744
THAT, BUT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT

1138
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,044
WE NEED TO KNOW IN THAT 

1139
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:31,314
DEPARTMENT?

1140
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:32,515
>> WELL, YOU HAVEN'T MISSED THAT

1141
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:33,616
SUCCESSION QUESTION IN AS I 

1142
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,717
REMEMBER ABOUT THE LAST FOUR 

1143
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:38,521
YEARS WITH ME.

1144
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:40,123
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 

1145
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:42,158
SUCCESSION PLANNING, AND I THINK

1146
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,260
YOU COULD LOOK AT THE FACT THAT 

1147
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:49,065
WE HAVE TWO NEW VICE CHAIR MEN 

1148
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:49,699
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH 

1149
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:52,034
EXPANDED RESPONSIBILITIES.

1150
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:53,135
AJIT THROUGHOUT THE INSURANCE 

1151
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:55,205
BUSINESSES AND GREG THROUGHOUT 

1152
00:52:53,202 --> 00:52:57,106
THE NON-INSURANCE BUSINESSES.

1153
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:58,208
YOU COULD LOOK ON THAT AS 

1154
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:00,143
SUCCESSION PLANNING.

1155
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:01,744
YOU COULD LOOK ON THE -- OUR TWO

1156
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:06,916
GREAT INVESTORS THAT HAVE BEEN 

1157
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:08,751
BROUGHT IN, TED AND TODD, AS 

1158
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,519
SUCCESSION PLANNING.

1159
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:11,053
ME?

1160
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:14,757
I LIKE TO DESCRIBE IT AS 

1161
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,493
MANAGEMENT EXTENSION.

1162
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:24,033
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE 

1163
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:26,970
ACTIVITIES OF GREG, AJIT, TWO Ts

1164
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:28,871
HAVE GIVEN NEW -- IN MY OPINION,

1165
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,239
NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR WARREN AND

1166
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:32,808
CHARLIE TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT 

1167
00:53:30,306 --> 00:53:35,645
THEY DO SO WELL AND, YOU KNOW, 

1168
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:37,280
GREG DOES A LOT MORE TRAVELING 

1169
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:39,215
THAN WARREN DOES THESE DAYS TO 

1170
00:53:37,346 --> 00:53:40,950
THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES.

1171
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:42,385
NOW IF YOU ASK WARREN ANY 

1172
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:43,953
QUESTION ABOUT ANY OF THE 

1173
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:46,122
BUSINESSES HE'S GOT IT ON THE 

1174
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:48,624
TIP OF HIS TONGUE, READING ALL 

1175
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:52,828
THE TIME, BUT IN TERMS OF 

1176
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:59,269
SHOWING UP FOR THE CELEBRATION 

1177
00:53:52,895 --> 00:54:00,470
OF A TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 

1178
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,004
CEO.

1179
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:04,407
FWR

1180
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:06,042
GREG IS THERE -- WE LOST A GREAT

1181
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,210
ONE, PAUL ANDREWS FOR TTI, JUST 

1182
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,911
IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

1183
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:12,315
I KNOW WARREN WAS AT THAT 

1184
00:54:08,978 --> 00:54:15,718
FUNERAL WITH GREG.

1185
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:18,688
IT IS -- IN MY MIND, WHY WOULD 

1186
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:21,758
WE WANT TO THROW AWAY THE 

1187
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:23,426
LIFETIME OF EXPERIENCE THESE TWO

1188
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:25,361
GUYS HAVE HAD AND BRING TO BEAR 

1189
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:26,562
ON EVERY IMPORTANT JUDGMENT THIS

1190
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:29,999
COMPANY MAKES?

1191
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:30,900
SO THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT 

1192
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:33,436
TIMETABLE.

1193
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:34,937
EVERY MEETING WE DIRECTORS TALK 

1194
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:36,972
ABOUT SUCCESSION.

1195
00:54:35,004 --> 00:54:38,408
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TOMORROW, 

1196
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,176
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING

1197
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:41,544
TO DO, BUT THAT'S ABOUT AS FAR 

1198
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:44,246
AS I GO WITH THIS QUESTION.

1199
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:47,016
AND I WOULD SAY THIS, YOU KNOW, 

1200
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:48,451
LOOK AT HOW -- IN ADDITION TO 

1201
00:54:47,082 --> 00:54:53,856
THE TWO VICE CHAIRS, THE WAY 

1202
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:57,327
THIS COMPANY OPERATES, IT'S 

1203
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:59,962
CREATED MANAGEMENT THAT HAVE HAD

1204
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:02,165
THE EXPERIENCE EVER BEING THEIR 

1205
00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:04,333
OWN BUSINESS BOSSES.

1206
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:05,702
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO GROW TALENT 

1207
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,437
AS WELL AS GROW THE COMPANY. 

1208
00:55:05,768 --> 00:55:08,237
>> QUICK LAST QUESTION, RON.

1209
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,139
ANYTHING WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT 

1210
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,374
THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS THAT 

1211
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,975
ARE BEING PUT FORTH TODAY?

1212
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:17,213
>> I DON'T THINK ANYTHING THAT 

1213
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:19,582
ISN'T IN OUR PROXY.

1214
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:23,252
YOU KNOW, I'M CONFIDENT THAT OUR

1215
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:25,555
SHAREHOLDERS ARE GOING TO BACK 

1216
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:28,257
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS BUT, YOU 

1217
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:30,059
KNOW, THERE'S -- ALL OF IT IS 

1218
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,760
BEING PRESENTED, YOU TAKE 

1219
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:33,029
CLIMATE CHANGE.

1220
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:35,231
WE TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY.

1221
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:37,066
AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE 

1222
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:40,069
UTILITIES ARE DOING, YOU LOOK AT

1223
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:43,172
WHAT BANF ARE DOING, WE'VE GOT 

1224
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:46,543
LOTS OF EXAMPLES OUT THERE OF US

1225
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:50,613
BECOMING MORE EFFICIENT, ADDING 

1226
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:50,880
I THINK TO THE STRENGTH OF OUR 

1227
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,716
COMPANIES.

1228
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:56,752
AND IT'S -- WE'RE -- I THINK 

1229
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:59,655
THEY WILL BE DEFEATED BUT THAT'S

1230
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:02,258
FOR US TO FIND OUT LATER TODAY.

1231
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:02,759

I'D LOVE TO START WITH WHAT 

1259
00:59:09,278 --> 00:59:13,215
YOU'VE LEARNED FROM THESE COUPLE

1260
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:14,783
OF GUYS TALK, NOW THE FIFTH YEAR

1261
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:16,152
YAHOO! FINANCE HAS STREAMED THE 

1262
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:17,753
LIVE COVERAGE AND I THINK OPENED

1263
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,622
UP, YOU KNOW, THE WORLD OF 

1264
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:21,324
WISDOM WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FOR SO 

1265
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,524
MANY YEARS TO FOLKS AROUND THE 

1266
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,457
GLOBE.

1267
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:24,360
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1268
00:59:22,524 --> 00:59:25,427
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

1269
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:27,196
THERE IS SO MUCH THAT I'VE 

1270
00:59:25,494 --> 00:59:28,897
LEARNED FROM WARREN BUFFETT AS 

1271
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:33,269
WELL AS CHARLIE MUNGER.

1272
00:59:28,964 --> 00:59:35,771
FOR ONE, THEY'VE TALKED OVER THE

1273
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:36,004
YEARS TO NOT INVEST WITH YOU'RE 

1274
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,707
MOTION.

1275
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:38,941
IT'S SO EASY FOR US TO DO THAT.

1276
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:40,343
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF STOCKS 

1277
00:59:39,007 --> 00:59:42,978
THAT ARE ON THE MARKET.

1278
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,779
WE CAN DEFINITELY FALL INTO WHAT

1279
00:59:43,045 --> 00:59:45,081
IS TRENDY.

1280
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:46,715
WHAT ARE THE BUZZ WORDS.

1281
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:48,817
HOWEVER, WHEN IT COMES TO BEING 

1282
00:59:46,782 --> 00:59:51,921
A SUCCESSFUL INVESTOR, WE HAVE 

1283
00:59:48,884 --> 00:59:53,355
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PULLING

1284
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:55,357
OURSELVES AWAY FROM THE CROWD 

1285
00:59:53,422 --> 00:59:57,259
AND INVESTING IN WHAT WE KNOW 

1286
00:59:55,424 --> 00:59:58,560
AND WHAT WE HAVE RESEARCHED.

1287
00:59:57,326 --> 01:00:00,229
WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM WARREN 

1288
00:59:58,627 --> 01:00:03,132
OVER THE YEARS IS TO MAKE SURE 

1289
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:05,000
THAT I DO MY RESEARCH, AND IF I 

1290
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:07,236
CANNOT UNDERSTAND A BUSINESS, 

1291
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:09,705
THEN I MOST DEFINITELY WOULD NOT

1292
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:12,207
INVEST IN IT.

1293
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,275
AND WITH THAT BEING SAID, 

1294
01:00:12,274 --> 01:00:14,877
LOOKING AT STOCKS THAT I BELIEVE

1295
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:16,845
ARE UNDER PRICED BY THE MARKET 

1296
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:20,649
AND THE ONES THAT I FEEL AS 

1297
01:00:16,912 --> 01:00:24,420
THOUGH THE PRICES WILL 

1298
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:25,655
EVENTUALLY RISE SIGNIFICANTLY 

1299
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:28,924
OVER TIME.

1300
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:29,892
>> BAHIYAH, TELL US ABOUT BROWN 

1301
01:00:28,991 --> 01:00:30,660
GIRLS DO INVEST.

1302
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,227
WHAT IS THAT ORGANIZATION?

1303
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,862
>> OH, MY GOODNESS, THANK YOU 

1304
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:34,697
FOR ASKING.

1305
01:00:32,928 --> 01:00:36,865
BROWN GIRLS DO INVEST IS A 

1306
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:37,967
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION, AND WE 

1307
01:00:36,932 --> 01:00:40,269
TEACH AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN HOW

1308
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:42,938
TO INVEST IN THE STOCK MARKET, 

1309
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:45,675
HOW TO INVEST IN REAL ESTATE AS 

1310
01:00:43,005 --> 01:00:46,475
WELL AS ACQUIRE MULTIPLE STREAMS

1311
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:49,144
OF INCOME.

1312
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,379
WE BASICALLY FOLLOW WHAT WARREN 

1313
01:00:49,211 --> 01:00:51,380
BUFFETT TEACHES ABOUT, WHICH IS 

1314
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:53,416
VALUE INVESTING.

1315
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:55,484
WE MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE ARE 

1316
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:57,186
INVESTING, IT'S FOR A LONG-TERM 

1317
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:59,021
STRATEGY AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING

1318
01:00:57,253 --> 01:01:00,155
SHORT TERM.

1319
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:01,790
THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WANT 

1320
01:01:00,222 --> 01:01:03,092
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE 

1321
01:01:01,857 --> 01:01:05,961
EARNING MONEY AS QUICKLY AS 

1322
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:08,063
POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, WE WANT TO 

1323
01:01:06,028 --> 01:01:09,498
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO 

1324
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:11,300
UNDERSTAND THEIR RISK TOLERANCE 

1325
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:14,703
BY ASKING A FEW QUESTIONS, 

1326
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:15,371
DETERMINING THEIR AGE, AS WELL 

1327
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:16,805
AS WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO RETIRE 

1328
01:01:15,437 --> 01:01:22,011
AND TO UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE 

1329
01:01:16,872 --> 01:01:23,679
BEST STRATEGIES IS TO HOLD ON AS

1330
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,714
WELL AS ADDRESS SOME OF THE 

1331
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,482
INFLATION THAT IS GOING ON THAT 

1332
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,349
IS NOT GOING TO BE CONDUCIVE TO 

1333
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:29,585
OUR BUYING POWER.

1334
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:31,086
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WARREN

1335
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:32,421
BUFFETT DOES WITH HIS STRATEGY 

1336
01:01:31,153 --> 01:01:35,457
AS FAR AS BUY AND HOLD AND LOOK 

1337
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:40,296
AT OVER THE PAST 14 YEARS HOW 

1338
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:43,432
STOCKS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE

1339
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,733
EARNED 9.2%, YOU CANNOT GO 

1340
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:45,367
WRONG.

1341
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,436
SO WITH BROWN GIRLS DO INVEST, 

1342
01:01:45,434 --> 01:01:50,005
WE MAKE SURE THAT WE EDUCATE ON 

1343
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:50,238
HOW TO INVEST IN THE STOCK 

1344
01:01:50,072 --> 01:01:52,708
MARKET.

1345
01:01:50,305 --> 01:01:54,610
>> YOU KNOW, BAHIYAH, SOMETHING 

1346
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:56,011
I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM 

1347
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:57,379
WARREN AND CHARLIE ABOUT TODAY, 

1348
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:58,914
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WITH 

1349
01:01:57,446 --> 01:02:00,649
CRYPTO, THE MEME STOCKS.

1350
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:06,923
THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO INVEST

1351
01:02:00,716 --> 01:02:07,689
ON THINGS LIKE ROBINHOOD.

1352
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,458
IT'S DRIVEN INTEREST IN STOCKS 

1353
01:02:07,756 --> 01:02:10,559
AND I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN

1354
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:11,960
YOUR WORK AS WELL.

1355
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:14,130
I'M CURIOUS HOW YOU'VE GONE 

1356
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:16,265
ABOUT EDUCATING PEOPLE TRYING TO

1357
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:18,233
GET IN AND OUT ON A DAY'S BASIS,

1358
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:20,135
A WEEK OR A MONTH'S BASIS, THAT 

1359
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:22,538
WILL LIKELY, LIKELY ERODE YOUR 

1360
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:23,438
GAINS OVER TIME AND HOW THAT 

1361
01:02:22,604 --> 01:02:35,451
CONVERSATION HAS MAYBE CHANGED 

1362
01:02:23,505 --> 01:02:37,086
OVER THE LAST YEAR WHEN INTEREST

1363
01:02:35,517 --> 01:02:37,720
IN THE STOCKS AND THE MARKET HAS

1364
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:38,387
GONE UP. 

1365
01:02:37,786 --> 01:02:40,189
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1366
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:41,223
DON'T ENGAGE IN THE BUZZ WORD.

1367
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:45,728
NOT TO DO WHAT YOU FEEL AS 

1368
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:48,163
THOUGH YOUR NEIGHBOR IS DOING 

1369
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:50,332
AND TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE 

1370
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,599
INVESTING OFF OF YOUR INVESTMENT

1371
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:52,467
NEEDS.

1372
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:53,135
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE THE 

1373
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:58,807
CRYPTOCURRENCY AND OTHER THINGS 

1374
01:02:53,201 --> 01:03:00,776
TO INVEST IN OVER THE YEARS, TO 

1375
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:02,444
MAKE SURE WE TELL INVESTORS TO 

1376
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:05,147
DO WHAT BUFFETT ENCOURAGES US TO

1377
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:05,380
DO, WHICH IS TO RESEARCH THE 

1378
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:08,617
COMPANY.

1379
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:13,422
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO ENGAGE IN 

1380
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:15,224
BUZZ WORDS OR STRTRENDY THINGS T

1381
01:03:13,488 --> 01:03:15,424
ARE OCCURRING, YOU DO NOT HAVE 

1382
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,426
TIME.

1383
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:18,794
IN ADDITION TO RESEARCHING THE 

1384
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:20,295
COMPANY, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE 

1385
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:21,964
WHATEVER YOU ARE INVESTING IN 

1386
01:03:20,362 --> 01:03:23,565
HAS A STRONG LEADERSHIP TEAM AS 

1387
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:25,133
WELL AS ARE THEY PROFITABLE.

1388
01:03:23,632 --> 01:03:26,668
LOOK AT THEIR PERFORMANCE AND 

1389
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:30,039
THEIR RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND 

1390
01:03:26,735 --> 01:03:31,807
TRY TO AVOID OVER VALUED STOCKS.

1391
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:33,809
AGAIN, THE THING WITH INVESTING 

1392
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:35,144
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE 

1393
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,444
INVESTING LONG TERM, NOT 

1394
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,745
TRADING.

1395
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:39,248
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE 

1396
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:42,784
TALK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO 

1397
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:44,286
CRYPTOCURRENCY AS WELL AS ANY 

1398
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:44,820
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE IN 

1399
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:45,454
THE STOCK MARKET.

1400
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:49,258
>> ALL RIGHT.

1401
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:52,428
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE IT 

1402
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:53,796

1425
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:55,711
ANYTHING EARTH SHATTERING GOING 

1426
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:57,345

1427
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:58,847
BERKSHIRE'S BUSINESS IS FIRING 

1428
01:06:57,412 --> 01:07:03,085
ON ALL CYLINDERS.

1429
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:04,820
IT'S GOTTEN A TERRIFIC TAILWIND 

1430
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:06,221
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S 

1431
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:08,090
ADDING ROCKET FUEL TO BERKSHIRE 

1432
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:10,826

SHARING PURCHASES.

1435

THE SHARE COUNT IS DOWN 5.5% 

1436
01:07:14,963 --> 01:07:17,899
YEAR OVER YEAR.

1437
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,134
BERKSHIRE HAS JOINED THE RANKS

SHARE BUYBACKS AND THAT'S 

1441
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:27,175
TURNING MID SINGLE DIGIT TO HIGH

1442
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:29,711
SINGLE DIGIT SORT OF EMBEDDED

1453
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:50,666
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO

1454
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:52,067
TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

1455
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,502
WE DID SPEAK ABOUT THAT BACK 

1456
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:55,070
WHEN YOU PUT OUT THE ANNUAL 

1457
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:57,306
LETTER AS YOU MENTIONED.

1458
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:58,273

01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,675

1460
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,942

1461
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,710
PRICE.

1462
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:02,877
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU SEE 

1463
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:04,446
FURTHER UP SIDE HERE.

1464
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:06,515
WHAT ARE YOU KIND OF EXPECTING 

1465
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:06,748
TO BE THE CATALYST GOING 

1466
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,683
FORWARD?

1467
01:08:06,815 --> 01:08:10,119
>> YEAH.

1468
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,453
WELL, LOOK, THE STOCK HIT AN 

1469
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:12,888
ALL-TIME HIGH ON THURSDAY, 

1470
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,790
PULLED BACK A LITTLE ON FRIDAY 

1471
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:17,559
AND IT'S RESTING BUT 

1472
01:08:15,857 --> 01:08:19,194
NEVERTHELESS I JUST RECALCULATED

1473
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:22,497
BASED ON THE Q1 NUMBERS THIS 

1474
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:23,966
MORNING USING JUST A VERY SIMPLE

1475
01:08:22,564 --> 01:08:26,768
VALUATION METHODOLOGY.

1476
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:29,805
I'VE USED IT FOR 20 YEARS.

1477
01:08:26,835 --> 01:08:33,108
IT'S PROVED TO BE VERY ACCURATE.

1478
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:33,408
IT'S WHAT BUFFETT AND MUNGER 

1479
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:37,479

1480
01:08:33,475 --> 01:08:38,914
PUT AN 11 MULTIPLE ON THE PRETAX

1481
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:41,016
EARNINGS AND MY LATEST 

1482
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:43,285
CALCULATION IS IS THAT

01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:50,259
VALUE IS $473,000 PER A SHARE.

01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:53,495
THAT'S $316 PER B SHARE.

1486
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:54,896
THE STOCK CLOSED ON FRIDAY AT 

1487
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:57,900
412,000 PER A SHARE MEANING THE 

1488
01:08:54,963 --> 01:08:59,234
STOCK TODAY IS TRADING AT A 13% 

1489
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,169
DISCOUNT TO INTRINSIC VALUE.

1490
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:08,410
GIVEN THE STOCK IS UP ALMOST 20%

1491
01:09:01,236 --> 01:09:08,643
THIS YEAR, INTRINSIC VALUE IS UP

1492

WHEN YOU ARE BUYING BACK BELOW

01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:35,337
INTRINSIC VALUE, THAT INCREASES 

1503
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:35,671
INTRINSIC VALUE FOR REMAINING 

1504
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,706
SHAREHOLDERS. 

1505
01:09:35,737 --> 01:09:39,074

ASIDE FROM THE BUYBACKS, HOW DO 

1508
01:09:41,009 --> 01:09:43,345
YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE PUTTING

1509
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:47,115
THE CASH TO WORK?

1510
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:47,883
>> WELL, IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE IT'S

1511
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:50,685
A TOUGH ENVIRONMENT OUT THERE.

1512
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:52,721
THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS -- 

1513
01:09:50,752 --> 01:09:53,355
>> WHITNEY, I'M SORRY TO 

1514
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:56,391
INTERRUPT YOU.

1515
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:56,792
WE HAVE TO GO OVER TO WARREN 

1516
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,728
BUFFETT.

1517
01:09:56,859 --> 01:10:01,029
THE 2021 BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY 

1518
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:04,766
ANNUAL MEETING HAS GONE. 

1519
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:05,033
>> WE DID IT ON SHORT NOTICE 

1520
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:07,736
LAST YEAR.

1521
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:11,239
WE HAD MORE WARNING THIS TIME 

1522
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:12,641
AND SO WE CAME TO LOS ANGELES 

1523
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:13,975
AND THE REASON WE'RE DOING IT 

1524
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:16,044
FROM HERE IS BECAUSE OF THE MAN 

1525
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:18,079
ON MY LEFT, NOT BECAUSE HE ASKED

1526
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:20,382
FOR IT BUT BECAUSE ALL OF US 

1527
01:10:18,146 --> 01:10:24,353
WANTED TO DO IT WITH CHARLIE 

1528
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:27,623
HERE IN LOS ANGELES.

1529
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:29,725
SO I'LL INTRODUCE THE THREE VICE

1530
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,092
CHAIR MEN OF BERKSHIRE IN A 

1531
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:36,632
MINUTE.

1532
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:36,899
I'LL SHOW YOU THE FIRST QUARTER 

1533
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:40,802
EARNINGS.

1534
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:44,773
WON'T TAKE MUCH TIME ON THAT.

1535
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:47,309
I'LL HAVE ONE OR TWO VERY SHORT 

1536
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,910
LESSONS FOR PERHAPS THE NEW 

1537
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:50,178
INVESTORS WHO ARE NOT 

1538
01:10:48,977 --> 01:10:51,646
NECESSARILY IN BERKSHIRE 

1539
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:52,580
HATHAWAY BUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

1540
01:10:51,713 --> 01:10:54,282
ENTERED THE STOCK MARKET IN THE 

1541
01:10:52,647 --> 01:10:55,650
PAST YEAR, I THINK THERE HAVE 

1542
01:10:54,349 --> 01:10:56,785
BEEN A RECORD NUMBER THAT HAVE 

1543
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:58,353
ENTERED THE STOCK MARKET.

1544
01:10:56,852 --> 01:11:00,221
I'LL HAVE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES 

1545
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:05,594
FOR THEM AND THEN WE'LL SWING 

1546
01:11:00,288 --> 01:11:09,097
INTO A Q&A LED BY BECKY QUICK, 

1547
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:11,800
WHO'S LOOKED AT THOUSANDS OF 

1548
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:12,967
QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN 

1549
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:14,135

01:11:13,034 --> 01:11:19,941

AND WE WILL PUT UP ON CAMERA 

1552
01:11:20,008 --> 01:11:22,544
FROM TIME TO TIME THE WAY YOU 

1553
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:24,045
CAN COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH 

1554
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,947
HER IF YOU WANT TO SEND 

1555
01:11:24,112 --> 01:11:28,050
QUESTIONS IN DURING THE MEETING.

1556
01:11:26,014 --> 01:11:28,317
SHE GOT FLOODED WITH THEM LAST 

1557
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,452
TIME.

1558
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:31,720
SHE MIRACULOUSLY KEEPS SORTING 

1559
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:33,789
THEM OUT.

1560
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:35,090
SO FEEL FREE TO SEND IN A 

1561
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:37,059
QUESTION AND WE WILL HAVE A 

1562
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:37,359
QUESTION PERIOD FOR ABOUT 3 1/2 

1563
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:41,029
HOURS.

1564
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:44,900
THEN WE WILL FINALLY HAVE THE 

1565
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:47,302
ANNUAL MEETING, WHICH WON'T TAKE

1566
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:50,271
LONG, AT THE END.

1567
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:52,240
SO WITH THAT, I WOULD LIKE TO 

1568
01:11:50,338 --> 01:11:55,477
FIRST INTRODUCE THE THREE VICE 

1569
01:11:52,307 --> 01:11:57,112
CHAIR MEN OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY.

1570
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:58,680
I'LL TELL YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT 

1571
01:11:57,179 --> 01:12:03,118
ABOUT THEM AND THEN I'LL HAVE A 

1572
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:04,553
MILD SURPRISE FOR YOU AT THE END

1573
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:08,323
PERHAPS.

1574
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:14,763
ON MY LEFT IS CHARLIE MUNGER, 

1575
01:12:08,389 --> 01:12:21,069
AND I MET CHARLIE 62 YEARS AGO.

1576
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:21,970
HE WAS PRACTICING LAW IN LOS 

1577
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:23,671
ANGELES.

1578
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:27,409
HE WAS BUILDING A HOUSE AT THAT 

1579
01:12:23,738 --> 01:12:29,944
TIME A FEW MILES FROM HERE, AND 

1580
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:30,679
62 YEARS LATER HE'S STILL LIVING

1581
01:12:30,011 --> 01:12:31,747
IN THE SAME HOUSE.

1582
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:35,517
KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE I 

1583
01:12:31,813 --> 01:12:37,252
WAS BUYING A HOUSE JUST A FEW 

1584
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:38,620
MONTHS BEFORE 62 YEARS AGO AND 

1585
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:38,820
I'M STILL LIVING IN THE SAME 

1586
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:41,489
HOUSE.

1587
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:43,425
SO YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF FAIRLY

1588
01:12:41,556 --> 01:12:48,663
PECULIAR GUYS JUST TO START WITH

1589
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:51,266
IN TERMS OF THEIR LOVE AFFAIR 

1590
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:56,505
WITH THEIR HOMES.

1591
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:58,039
AND CHARLIE -- CHARLIE AND I HIT

1592
01:12:56,572 --> 01:13:02,844
IT OFF IMMEDIATELY.

1593
01:12:58,106 --> 01:13:04,446
I WOULD SAY HE'S -- HE'S 

1594
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:06,615
PROBABLY THE VICE CHAIRMAN IN 

1595
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:08,683
CHARGE OF CULTURE, AMONG OTHER 

1596
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:10,618
THINGS, BUT IF I EVER WANT TO 

1597
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:12,921
GET QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE TRUE 

1598
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:16,458
NORTH IS, I TALK TO CHARLIE AND 

1599
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:18,460
HE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS HELP.

1600
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:20,262
HE'S DONE IT WITH A LOT FEWER 

1601
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:22,197
HOURS AND A LOT LESS TALKING AND

1602
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:24,566
EVERYTHING THAT I'VE HAD, BUT 

1603
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:26,134
HE'S CONTRIBUTED IN AN 

1604
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:29,805
INCREDIBLE WAY TO BERKSHIRE.

1605
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:32,374
SO CHARLIE'S BEEN OUT HERE IN 

1606
01:13:29,871 --> 01:13:38,113
LOS ANGELES FOR 60 PLUS YEARS.

1607
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:41,449
ON MY RIGHT, YOUR LEFT, I HAVE 

1608
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:44,986
THE VICE CHAIRMAN IN CHARGE OF 

1609
01:13:41,516 --> 01:13:46,621
EVERYTHING EXCEPT INSURANCE AND 

1610
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:51,393
INVESTMENTS, GREG ABEL.

1611
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:52,461
GREG WAS BORN AND RAISED IN 

1612
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,028
EDMONTON, ALBERTA.

1613
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:55,764
CANADIAN.

1614
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:58,934
PLAYS HOCKEY.

1615
01:13:55,831 --> 01:14:02,404
80-YEAR-OLD, PLAYS HOCKEY.

1616
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:05,474
AND HE CAME TO THE UNITED STATES

1617
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:10,645
SOMETIME AFTER HE GRADUATED FROM

1618
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:15,483
COLLEGE IN CANADA AND HE IS IN 

1619
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:18,653
CHARGE OF A BUSINESS WHICH HAS 

1620
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:22,324
WELL OVER 150 BILLION IN SALES 

1621
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:26,528
AND EMPLOYS 200 -- MORE THAN 

1622
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:26,862
250,000, PROBABLY 275,000 

1623
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:29,697
PEOPLE.

1624
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:31,433
AND DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB AT 

1625
01:14:29,764 --> 01:14:31,900
DOING THAT THAN I WAS DOING 

1626
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:39,007
PREVIOUSLY.

1627
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:40,408
AND ON MY FAR LEFT, YOUR RIGHT, 

1628
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:42,110
WE HAVE AJIT JAIN.

1629
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:44,045
AJIT WAS BORN AND RAISED IN 

1630
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:44,346
INDIA AND GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE

1631
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:49,317
THERE.

1632
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:52,420
I MET AJIT ON A SATURDAY IN 

1633
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:54,222
1986, AND I'VE BEEN IN THE 

1634
01:14:52,487 --> 01:14:55,190
INSURANCE BUSINESS -- BERKSHIRE 

1635
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,491
HAD BEEN IN THE INSURANCE 

1636
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,326
BUSINESS FOR A WHILE.

1637
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:59,528
I WAS STUMBLING AROUND IN A 

1638
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:01,229
NUMBER OF WAYS.

1639
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:03,298
AJIT CAME INTO THE OFFICE.

1640
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:06,334
SATURDAY I WAS OPENING THE MAIL.

1641
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:08,069
I SAID, YOU KNOW, ABOUT 

1642
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:11,339
INSURANCE AND HE SAID, NOTHING.

1643
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:13,975
I SAID, WELL, NOBODY'S PERFECT.

1644
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:15,443
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT SOME.

1645
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:18,513
AND BY THE END OF THE MORNING I 

1646
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:21,249
KNEW I HAD SOMEBODY THAT WAS 

1647
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:23,118
GOING TO BUILD A GREAT INSURANCE

1648
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:25,754
BUSINESS, AND STARTING FROM THAT

1649
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:29,657
POINT THIS IMPROBABLE LITTLE 

1650
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:31,526
COMPANY IN OMAHA BECAME THE 

1651
01:15:29,724 --> 01:15:33,695
LARGEST PROPERTY CASUALTY 

1652
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:33,928
COMPANY IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF

1653
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:36,197
NETWORK.

1654
01:15:33,995 --> 01:15:38,767
IT WRITES RISKS THAT -- IT 

1655
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:42,437
WRITES RISKS OCCASIONALLY AND IN

1656
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:43,104
A 24-HOUR PERIOD THAT OTHER 

1657
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:44,172
COMPANIES SIMPLY COULDN'T TAKE 

1658
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:46,141
ON THEMSELVES.

1659
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:47,742
THEY'D HAVE TO ASSEMBLE OTHER 

1660
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:51,613
PEOPLE AND IT WOULD TAKE THEM A 

1661
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:52,547
LONG TIME TO COME TO A DECISION.

1662
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,248
THAT WAS VARIOUS AT OTHER TIMES 

1663
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:54,849
IN THE PAST.

1664
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:57,586
NOT SO IMPORTANT NOW.

1665
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:59,020
HE'S BUILT AN INCREDIBLE -- THE 

1666
01:15:57,653 --> 01:16:00,355
WORLD'S LEADING PROPERTY AND 

1667
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:05,827
CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY.

1668
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:08,163
SO HERE WE HAVE CHARLIE FROM 

1669
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,798
L.A., 60 SOME YEARS.

1670
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,966
WE'VE GOT GREG FROM CANADA.

1671
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:16,004
WE'VE GOT AJIT FROM INDIA AND 

1672
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:22,010
THE ONE THING IN COMMON THAT 

1673
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:22,344
THESE THREE FELLOWS HAVE ASIDE 

1674
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,479
F

1675
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:26,981
BERKSHIRE AND DOING A GREAT JOB,

1676
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:28,883
THE AT ONE PERIOD OF TIME OR 

1677
01:16:27,048 --> 01:16:31,820
ANOTHER THEY LIVED WITHIN A MILE

1678
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:38,159
OF ME IN OMAHA, NEBRASKA.

1679
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:40,862
AND CHARLIE IN 1934 MOVED ABOUT 

1680
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:43,498
100 YARDS AWAY FROM WHERE I NOW 

1681
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:45,700
LIVED AND WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL, 

1682
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:46,901
EVENTUALLY WENT INTO THE SERVICE

1683
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:51,206
AND KNOWS THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS 

1684
01:16:46,968 --> 01:16:52,640
WELL AS I DO.

1685
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:58,713
WENT TO THE SAME GRADE SCHOOL MY

1686
01:16:52,707 --> 01:17:02,517
KIDS WENT TO AND SO ON.

1687
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:04,152
GREG SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME IN 

1688
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:06,788
LIVING IN OMAHA.

1689
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:10,959
LIVED ABOUT FIVE OR SIX BLOCKS 

1690
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:11,226
FROM ME AND NOW LIVES IN DES 

1691
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:13,594
MOINES.

1692
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:17,065
AND AJIT WAS IN OMAHA, ABOUT A 

1693
01:17:13,661 --> 01:17:17,265
MILE AWAY, FOR A COUPLE OF 

1694
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,400
YEARS.

1695
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:22,337
SO WE STARTED IN VERY DIFFERENT 

1696
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:23,905
PLACES AND SORT OF CAME TOGETHER

1697
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:28,743
AND NOW GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS, 

1698
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:31,680
BUT IT'S ALL WORKED VERY WELL.

1699
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,946
I WOULD -- AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM 

1700
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:33,514
THEM.

1701
01:17:32,013 --> 01:17:34,749
I URGE YOU TO SEND QUESTIONS IF 

1702
01:17:33,581 --> 01:17:36,517
YOU'RE SAYING YOU COULD DIRECT 

1703
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:39,020
THEM TO ME OR YOU COULD DIRECT 

1704
01:17:36,584 --> 01:17:41,322
THEM TO ANY ONE OF THE OTHER 

1705
01:17:39,086 --> 01:17:42,490
THREE AND IT WILL BE A BIG 

1706
01:17:41,389 --> 01:17:47,696
RELIEF TO ME IF YOU DIRECT A 

1707
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:49,264
FAIR NUMBER TO THE OTHER PEOPLE.

1708
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:53,468
SO WE THIS MORNING, AS WE ALWAYS

1709
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:55,737

1710
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:57,238
SATURDAY, WE PUBLISHED OUR 10Q 

1711
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:59,441

EARNINGS THAT'S UP ON OUR 

1713
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:03,477
WEBSITE, BERKSHIREHATHAWAY.COM.

1714
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:07,549
AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING.

1715
01:18:03,544 --> 01:18:08,850
WE PUT THESE OUT ON SATURDAY 

1716
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:10,618
MORNING, THAT'S NOT BECAUSE THE 

1717
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:12,286
MEDIA LIKES US TO DO IT THAT 

1718
01:18:10,685 --> 01:18:14,055
WAY, THAT'S NOT BECAUSE THE 

1719
01:18:12,353 --> 01:18:16,057
ANALYSTS LIKE TO DO IT THAT WAY,

1720
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:22,430
BUT WE WANT TO GIVE YOU THE 

1721
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:23,664
MAXIMUM TIME TO DYE IGEST AN AW

LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S IN 

1723
01:18:23,731 --> 01:18:26,701
THAT 10Q.

1724
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:27,602
IT CAN'T BE SUMMARIZED IN A 

1725
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:30,639
PERFECT WAY.

1726
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:32,373
WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME SUMMARY 

1727
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:33,207
FIGURES, BUT THEY'RE REALLY A 

1728
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:36,611
STUDENT OF THE PLACE.

1729
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:38,813
MOST OF OUR INVESTORS SIMPLY 

1730
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:42,650
HAVE FAITH IN THESE OTHER THREE 

1731
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:44,919
FELLOWS TO DO A GOOD JOB.

1732
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:47,488
AND IT'S NOT A MISPLACED FAITH, 

1733
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:50,859
BUT IF YOU REALLY ENJOY GOING 

1734
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:54,429
INTO THE DETAILS AND YOU WANT TO

1735
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:56,998
UNDERSTAND THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF

1736
01:18:54,496 --> 01:19:00,335
THE VARIOUS OPERATIONS, YOU 

1737
01:18:57,065 --> 01:19:03,371
SHOULD READ THAT 10Q.

1738
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:04,439
IT WILL TAKE YOU -- IT MAY TAKE 

1739
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:06,307
YOU A COUPLE OF HOURS.

1740
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:08,042
I MEAN, IT'S NOT A SMALL 

1741
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:09,477
INVESTMENT OF TIME, BUT IT'S GOT

1742
01:19:08,109 --> 01:19:11,245
A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT ALL 

1743
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:13,881
OF OUR VARIOUS BUSINESSES AND 

1744
01:19:11,312 --> 01:19:16,417
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE 

1745
01:19:13,948 --> 01:19:20,922
BUSINESS STUDENTS OF A SORT, I 

1746
01:19:16,484 --> 01:19:23,458
RECOMMEND YOU GO TO IT.

1747
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:25,593
THE SUMMARY FIGURES YOU SEE 

1748
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:29,664
HERE, WHICH ARE THE ONES WE PUT 

1749
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:31,900
IN OUR PRESS RELEASE, SHOW KIND 

1750
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:32,133
OF AN INTERESTING PAIR OF 

1751
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:36,337
NUMBERS.

1752
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:38,906
DOWN THERE AT THE BOTTOM.

1753
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:40,474
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE -- LAST 

1754
01:19:38,973 --> 01:19:41,642
YEAR -- WHEN YOU SEE THOSE 

1755
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:43,344
BRACKETS AROUND NUMBERS, YOU'VE 

1756
01:19:41,709 --> 01:19:47,815
GOT TO START WORRYING.

1757
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:50,752
AND FIRST QUARTER WE ACTUALLY 

1758
01:19:47,882 --> 01:19:50,985
SHOWED A LOSS OF ALMOST $50 

1759
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:52,286
BILLION.

1760
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:55,723
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE A 

1761
01:19:52,353 --> 01:19:58,159
FIGURE LIKE THAT.

1762
01:19:55,790 --> 01:20:00,228
THINKING BACK, I WAS TRYING TO 

1763
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:01,629
REMEMBER WHETHER I HAD GONE ON 

1764
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:03,464
VACATION DURING THAT QUARTER AND

1765
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:05,400
TURNED THINGS OVER TO THE OTHER 

1766
01:20:03,531 --> 01:20:07,602
GUYS OR WHAT?

1767
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:08,236
BUT I CHECKED THE CALENDAR AND 

1768
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:10,505
THAT WAS ME.

1769
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:15,977
THAT FIGURE THIS YEAR IS A 

1770
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:18,346
POSITIVE FIGURE UP 11.7 BILLION,

1771
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:20,515
AND NEITHER FIGURE IS VERY 

1772
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:22,817
MEANINGFUL IN ITSELF.

1773
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:25,720
THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD A

1774
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:28,289
FEW YEARS AGO FOR MANY, MANY, 

1775
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:33,194
MANY, MANY YEARS UNREALIZED 

1776
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:35,863
GAINS OR LOSSES OF A COMPANY 

1777
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:37,432
LIKE BERKSHIRE WHERE THEY MADE 

1778
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:39,066
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE KNELT WORTH 

1779
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,001
OF BERKSHIRE BUT THEY DID NOT 

1780
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:43,338
RUN THROUGH EARNINGS.

1781
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:46,674
AND A FEW YEARS AGO THE RULE WAS

1782
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:50,444
CHANGED SO THAT EVERY TIME 

1783
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:52,247
STOCKS GO UP OR DOWN, IT GOES 

1784
01:20:50,511 --> 01:20:54,048
THROUGH OUR EARNINGS ACCOUNT.

1785
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:57,085
SO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF LAST 

1786
01:20:54,115 --> 01:21:02,890
YEAR WHEN STOCKS WENT DOWN A 

1787
01:20:57,152 --> 01:21:04,425
LOT, WE HAD A HUGE SUM OF 

1788
01:21:02,957 --> 01:21:07,261
UNREALIZED -- WELL, IT WAS A 

1789
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:08,763
REDUCTION OF UNREALIZED GAINS 

1790
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:10,398
AND WHEN YOU START SAYING THINGS

1791
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:14,869
LIKE THAT YOU START LOSING 

1792
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:16,070
PEOPLE BUT THAT ITEM, MILD PLUS 

1793
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:17,939
THIS YEAR.

1794
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:20,341
IF WE REPORTED EARNINGS DAILY 

1795
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:23,011
YOU WOULD SEE EARNINGS ONE DAY 

1796
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:23,878
OF 3 BILLION, NEXT DAY MINUS 2 

1797
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,779
BILLION.

1798
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:26,280
IT'S AN ACCOUNTING TREATMENT 

1799
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:28,316
THAT WE DON'T THINK IS 

1800
01:21:26,347 --> 01:21:33,821
PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE BUT 

1801
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:36,724
IT'S REQUIRED AND WE'VE 

1802
01:21:33,888 --> 01:21:39,427
EXPLAINED VERY CAREFULLY AND I 

1803
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:40,929
TRY TO WRITE IN MY LETTER AND 

1804
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:42,430
EXPLAIN I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE

1805
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:45,099
WAY TO LOOK AT BERKSHIRE.

1806
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:46,267
WE THINK OVER TIME WE WILL HAVE 

1807
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:48,636
INVESTMENT GAINS FOR REASONS I 

1808
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:50,538
LAY OUT IN MY LETTER.

1809
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:53,307
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THE 

1810
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:55,042
COMPANIES WE OWN STOCK IN, 

1811
01:21:53,374 --> 01:21:57,345
RETAIN EARNINGS, AND THEY USE 

1812
01:21:55,109 --> 01:21:58,846
THOSE REINVESTED EARNINGS 

1813
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,648
USUALLY TO OUR BENEFIT AND THAT 

1814
01:21:58,913 --> 01:22:00,982
SHOWS UP IN CAPITAL GAINS SOME 

1815
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:02,650
DAY.

1816
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:08,156
BUT REPORTED EARNINGS FOR A 

1817
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:10,892
COMPANY THAT HAS A LOT OF COMMON

1818
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:12,927
STOCKS, MARGINABLE STOCKS LIKE 

1819
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:13,695
OURS, YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT 

1820
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:17,398
THE FINAL LINE.

1821
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:18,166
YOU DO WANT TO LOOK AT THE 

1822
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:22,003
OPERATING EARNINGS LINE.

1823
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:25,507
NOW I WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU HAD 

1824
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:27,074
TAKEN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 

1825
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:28,509
LAST YEAR AND COMPARED TO THE 

1826
01:22:27,141 --> 01:22:29,777
FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THIS YEAR, 

1827
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:31,445
THOSE FIGURES WOULD HAVE BEEN 

1828
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:35,683
QUITE COMPARABLE, BUT OF COURSE 

1829
01:22:31,512 --> 01:22:37,218
IN MARCH OF 2020 THE ECONOMY WAS

1830
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:41,389
SHUT DOWN IN EFFECT.

1831
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:43,624
I MEAN, IT WAS A SELF-INDUCED 

1832
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:49,063
RECESSION, AND AN ABRUPT ONE, 

1833
01:22:43,691 --> 01:22:53,668
VERY ABRUPT.

1834
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:57,405
SO THE ECONOMY WENT OFF A CLIFF.

1835
01:22:53,735 --> 01:23:00,575
IN MARCH IT WAS RESURRECTED IN 

1836
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:06,080
AN EXTRAORDINARILY EFFECTIVE WAY

1837
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:08,216
BY FEDERAL RESERVE ACTION AND 

1838
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:09,483
LATER ON THE FISCAL FRONT BY 

1839
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:20,361
CONGRESS, AND WE'LL GET INTO 

1840
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:24,532
THAT LATER, BUT THE FIGURE YOU 

1841
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:29,404
S

1842
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:29,671
SEE, THE DIFFERENCE WAS MARCH 

1843
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:31,773
BASICALLY.

1844
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:33,441
WHAT OUR BUSINESSES HAVE DONE 

1845
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,075
WE'LL GET INTO MORE SPECIFICS 

1846
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:35,143
LATER.

1847
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:35,376
OUR BUSINESSES HAVE DONE QUITE 

1848
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,445
WELL.

1849
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:40,348
THIS HAS BEEN A VERY, VERY, VERY

1850
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:44,985
UNUSUAL RECESSION IN THAT IT'S 

1851
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:48,289
BEEN LOCALIZED AS THE INDUSTRY 

1852
01:23:45,052 --> 01:23:51,625
TO AN EXTRAORDINARY EXTENT.

1853
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:53,461
RIGHT NOW BUSINESS IS REALLY 

1854
01:23:51,692 --> 01:23:55,263
VERY GOOD.

1855
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:57,398
GREAT IN MANY SEGMENTS OF THE 

1856
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:58,900
ECONOMY WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT 

1857
01:23:57,465 --> 01:24:00,901
LATER, BUT THERE'S STILL 

1858
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:03,438
PROBLEMS IF YOU'RE IN A FEW 

1859
01:24:00,968 --> 01:24:05,940
TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE 

1860
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:07,108
BEEN DECIMATED SUCH AS 

1861
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,308
INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL AND THE 

1862
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:09,077
SORT.

1863
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:11,012
SO WITH THAT, WE'LL GO BACK TO 

1864
01:24:09,143 --> 01:24:13,014
THE FIGURES LATER ON.

1865
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:13,581
PERHAPS IN SOME OF THE 

1866
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:16,517
QUESTIONS.

1867
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:18,452
I WOULD LIKE TO JUST GO OVER TWO

1868
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:22,890
ITEMS THAT WOULD LIKE 

1869
01:24:18,519 --> 01:24:25,993
PARTICULARLY NEW ENTRANTS TO THE

1870
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:29,230
STOCK MARKET TO PONDER JUST A 

1871
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:33,267
BIT BEFORE THEY TRY AND DO 30 OR

1872
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:35,736
40 TRADES A DAY IN ORDER TO 

1873
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:40,608
PROFIT FROM WHAT LOOKS LIKE A 

1874
01:24:35,803 --> 01:24:45,980
VERY EASY GAME.

1875
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:52,587
I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SLIDE L1.

1876
01:24:46,046 --> 01:24:57,758
PUT THAT UP.

1877
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:59,793
AND THESE -- ON MARCH 31st I RAN

1878
01:24:57,825 --> 01:25:05,699
OFF A LIST OF THE 20 LARGEST 

1879
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:07,568
COMPANIES IN THE WORLD BY STOCK 

1880
01:25:05,766 --> 01:25:09,303
MARKET VALUE, AND THOSE NAMES, A

1881
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:10,771
GOOD MANY OF WHICH WILL BE 

1882
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:13,541
FAMILIAR TO YOU, BUT THEY WERE 

1883
01:25:10,838 --> 01:25:16,377
LED BY APPLE THAT'S SLIGHTLY 

1884
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:18,412
OVER 2 TRILLION.

1885
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:21,149
AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE NUMBER 

1886
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:25,519
20th WAS WORTH 330 ODD BILLION.

1887
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:27,121
THOSE ARE THE 20 LARGEST 

1888
01:25:25,586 --> 01:25:29,157
COMPANIES IN THE WORLD BY MARKET

1889
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:30,858
VALUE ON MARCH 31st.

1890
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:33,327
NOW IF I HAD A LITTLE -- I WAS 

1891
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:35,229
HOPING I COULD GET A LITTLE QUIZ

1892
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:39,500
MACHINE SO I COULD HAVE EVERYONE

1893
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:42,069
WEIGH IN ON THIS ANSWER AND WE 

1894
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:43,671
COULD FLASH IT UP LATER.

1895
01:25:42,136 --> 01:25:45,373
WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IS 

1896
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:49,477
LOOK AT THAT LIST.

1897
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:52,513
STARTS OFF WITH APPLE, SAUDI 

1898
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:53,514
ARAMCO'S A SPECIALIZED 

1899
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:55,783
COUNTRY -- COMPANY.

1900
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:58,052
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S 95% 

1901
01:25:55,850 --> 01:26:01,689
OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR WHAT,

1902
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:05,293
BUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY A COUNTRY 

1903
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:05,893
FOR SALE IN TERMS OF THAT 

1904
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:09,030
BUSINESS.

1905
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:10,464
THE TOP -- OF THE TOP SIX 

1906
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:10,898
COMPANIES, FIVE OF THEM ARE 

1907
01:26:10,531 --> 01:26:14,268
AMERICAN.

1908
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:17,838
I CAN HEAR PEOPLE SAY AMERICA 

1909
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:22,143
HAS -- IT'S NOT WORKING VERY 

1910
01:26:17,905 --> 01:26:24,111
WELL OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT.

1911
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:25,846
SIX TOP COMPANIES IN VALUE, FIVE

1912
01:26:24,178 --> 01:26:27,214
OF THEM ARE IN THE UNITED STATES

1913
01:26:25,913 --> 01:26:29,617
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE 

1914
01:26:27,281 --> 01:26:29,817
TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT THIS LAST 

1915
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:34,288
YEAR.

1916
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:36,857
IN 1790 WE HAD 1/2 OF 1% OF THE 

1917
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:40,294
WORLD'S POPULATION.

1918
01:26:36,924 --> 01:26:42,163
A LITTLE LESS.

1919
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:43,531
OOF,000 PEOPLE WERE SLAVES.

1920
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:46,601
IRELAND HAD MORE PEOPLE THAN THE

1921
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:50,805
UNITED STATES HAD.

1922
01:26:46,668 --> 01:26:53,641
RUSSIA HAD AS MANY TIMES AS -- 

1923
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,874
>> UKRAINE HAD TWICE AS MANY 

1924
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:57,845
PEOPLE.

1925
01:26:53,941 --> 01:27:02,216
WHAT DID WE HAVE?

1926
01:26:57,912 --> 01:27:04,051
WE HAD A MAP OF THE FUTURE, 

1927
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:08,189
ASPIRATIONAL MAP THAT SOMEHOW 

1928
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:13,260
NOW ONLY 200 -- WELL, AFTER THE 

1929
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:16,463
CONSTITUTION, 232 YEARS LATER 

1930
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:20,301
LEAVES SUS WITH FIVE OF THE TOP 

1931
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:21,969
SIX COMPANIES IN THE WORLD.

1932
01:27:20,368 --> 01:27:24,739
THAT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT AND IT'S 

1933
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:26,774
NOT BECAUSE WE WERE WAY SMARTER,

1934
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:28,075
WAY STRONGER OR ANYTHING OF THE 

1935
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:32,747
SORT.

1936
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:34,782
WE HAD GOOD SOIL, DECENT 

1937
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:37,351
CLIMATE, BUT SO DID SOME OF THE 

1938
01:27:34,848 --> 01:27:43,024
OTHER COUNTRIES I NAMED.

1939
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:45,059
THIS SYSTEM HAS WORKED VERY 

1940
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:48,696
WELL.

1941
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:54,935
IMAGINE THINKING OF A COUNTRY 

1942
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:56,303
WITH 1/2 OF THE LIST.

1943
01:27:55,002 --> 01:27:58,706
WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IS 

1944
01:27:56,370 --> 01:28:02,209
LOOK AT THAT LIST FOR A MINUTE 

1945
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:08,816
OR TWO IF YOU WANT TO AND THEN 

1946
01:28:02,276 --> 01:28:09,183
MAKE AN ESTIMATE, YOUR YOEN OWN 

1947
01:28:08,882 --> 01:28:14,254
GUEST.

1948
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:14,555
HERE THEY ARE, THESE POWE

1949
01:28:14,321 --> 01:28:16,190
POWERHOUSES.

1950
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:20,795
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ALL 20.

1951
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:22,163
IT MAY NOT BE ALL 20 TODAY OR 

1952
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:27,735
TOMORROW.

1953
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:28,569
THIS WAS MARCH 31st, BUT WHAT 

1954
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:30,771
WOULD YOU GUESS?

1955
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:32,239
THINK ABOUT THAT YOURSELF.

1956
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:33,440
WOULD YOU PUT DOWN FIVE, EIGHT?

1957
01:28:32,306 --> 01:28:36,643
WHATEVER IT WOULD BE, I WOULD 

1958
01:28:33,507 --> 01:28:41,482
NOW INVITE YOU TO LOOK AT SLIDE 

1959
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:45,786
2 -- WELL, 2, WHICH GOES BACK A 

1960
01:28:41,549 --> 01:28:51,625
LITTLE MORE THAN 30 YEARS.

1961
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:54,261
LOOK AT THE TOP 20 FROM 1989 AND

1962
01:28:51,692 --> 01:28:55,696
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP 20 FROM 

1963
01:28:54,328 --> 01:28:57,197
1989, THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT 

1964
01:28:55,763 --> 01:29:00,101
SHOULD GRAB YOUR INTEREST, AT 

1965
01:28:57,264 --> 01:29:02,803
LEAST TWO.

1966
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:05,706
NONE OF THE 20 FROM 30 YEARS AGO

1967
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:08,976
ARE ON THE PRESENT LIST, NONE, 

1968
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:11,245
ZERO.

1969
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:12,680
DUH, THERE WERE SIX U.K. 

1970
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:13,681
COMPANIES ON THE LIST AND THEIR 

1971
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:15,382
NAMES ARE FAMILIAR TO YOU.

1972
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:21,756
WE HAVE GENERAL ELECTRIC, WE 

1973
01:29:15,449 --> 01:29:28,329
HAVE EXXON, IBM CORP.

1974
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:32,333
MERCK HAS DONE THEIR NUMBER.

1975
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:35,102
YUN MADE IT.

1976
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:38,906
I ASKED YOU TO PLAY THE QUIZ.

1977
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:42,643
I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE ZERO 

1978
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:43,410
BUT IT IS A REMINDER OF WHAT 

1979
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:47,748
EXTRAORDINARY THINGS ARE GOING 

1980
01:29:43,477 --> 01:29:49,617
TO HAPPEN, THINGS THAT SEEM 

1981
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:51,618
OBVIOUS TO YOU.

1982
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:52,720
JAPAN HAD THIS WONDERFUL BULL 

1983
01:29:51,685 --> 01:29:59,626
MARKET FOR A LONG TIME.

1984
01:29:52,787 --> 01:30:02,496
YOU HAD A NUMBER OF JAPANESE 

1985
01:29:59,693 --> 01:30:07,134
COUPLES ON THE CASE.

1986
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:08,936
UNITED STATES HAS THE 6, AND I 

1987
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:13,641
WOULD INVITE YOU TO LOOK AT ONE 

1988
01:30:09,003 --> 01:30:14,141
OTHER THING AS YOU LOOK AT THIS 

1989
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:14,575
ADD

1990
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:20,981
ADDRESS.

1991
01:30:14,642 --> 01:30:22,550
WE WEREN'T JUST KISS COVERING 

1992
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:23,684
CAPITALISM.

1993
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:26,487
PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE IN.

1994
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:28,222
IT WAS NOT A BACKWARD TIME AND 

1995
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:30,624
IF YOU LOOKED AT THE TOP COMPANY

1996
01:30:28,288 --> 01:30:33,260
AT THAT TIME HAD A MARKET VALUE 

1997
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:37,064
OF 104 BILLION.

1998
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:40,300
SO THE LARGEST COMPANY IN THE 

1999
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:43,937
WORLD OF TITLE IN JUST A SHADE 

2000
01:30:40,367 --> 01:30:45,172
OVER 30 YEARS HAS GONE FROM 100 

2001
01:30:44,004 --> 01:30:49,443
BILLION TO 2 TRILLION.

2002
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:56,817
AT THE BOTTOM THE NUMBER 20 HAS 

2003
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:59,153
GONE FROM 34, A LITTLE OVER TEN 

2004
01:30:56,884 --> 01:31:03,958
TIMES THAT.

2005
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:06,694
THIS TELLS YOU WHAT'S HAPPENED.

2006
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:08,028
IT TELLS YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 

2007
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:10,064
INFLATION, BUT THIS WAS NOT A 

2008
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:10,331
HIGHLY INFLATIONARY PERIOD AS A 

2009
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:16,036
WHOLE.

2010
01:31:10,398 --> 01:31:19,139
BUT IT TELLS YOU THAT CAPITALISM

2011
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:22,877
HAS WORKED INCREDIBLY WELL, 

2012
01:31:19,206 --> 01:31:23,644
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE THE 

2013
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:28,516
CAPITALIST.

2014
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:28,749
IT'S A PRETTY A STAUNDING 

2015
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:32,352
NUMBER.

2016
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:36,524
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TAKE 2 

2017
01:31:32,419 --> 01:31:36,791
TRILLION FOR THE THE R FINE 

2018
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:38,158
COMPANIES.

2019
01:31:36,857 --> 01:31:39,527
THAT'S FOR THE LEADER.

2020
01:31:38,225 --> 01:31:42,229
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.

2021
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:43,130
MAYBE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

2022
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:45,899
WE WERE JUST AS SURE OF 

2023
01:31:43,197 --> 01:31:48,869
OURSELVES AS INVESTORS OUT OF 

2024
01:31:45,966 --> 01:31:59,246
WALL STREET WAS IN 1989 AS WE 

2025
01:31:48,936 --> 01:32:00,047
ARE TODAY, BUT THE WORLD DIDN'T 

2026
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:03,350
CHANGE.

2027
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:06,353
I'LL JUST GIVE YOU ONE OTHER 

2028
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:13,727
EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT PONDER.

2029
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:17,498
ONE THING IT SHOWS IS THAT IT'S 

2030
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:18,565
A GREAT ARGUMENT.

2031
01:32:17,564 --> 01:32:19,900
THE AMAZING THING WAS TO BE 

2032
01:32:18,632 --> 01:32:21,735
ABOARD A SHIP.

2033
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:23,503
THEY WERE GOING TO A BETTER 

2034
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:28,208
PROMISED LAND, THEY DIDN'T KNOW 

2035
01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:31,011
WHICH ONE THEY NIECELY GOT ON.

2036
01:32:28,275 --> 01:32:35,215
YOU OO OO GROUP. 

2037
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:36,383
>> THEY NEED U.S. EQUITIES, MY 

2038
01:32:35,282 --> 01:32:40,187
PURPOSE.

2039
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:44,391
DO A HOLDOVER, YEAR-TO-YEAR 

2040
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:53,533
PERIOD.

2041
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:54,368
>> IF YOU THINK HELEN WILL 

2042
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,837
REBUILD THESE.

2043
01:32:54,435 --> 01:33:04,812
OVERALL EQUITIES WERE ABSOLUTELY

2044
01:32:56,904 --> 01:33:08,649
THE PLACE TO BE.

2045
01:33:04,879 --> 01:33:13,420
SECONDLY, PEOPLE GET ENORMOUSLY 

2046
01:33:08,716 --> 01:33:15,122
ATTRACTED TO VARIOUS INDUSTRIES.

2047
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:20,094
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK IF PEOPLE 

2048
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:26,800
SAY IT'S IN THE X, Y, Z COMPANY.

2049
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:30,404
YOU CAN SEM I P OOs MP YOU KNOW,

2050
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:34,942
IT'S THE PLACE TO BE.

2051
01:33:30,471 --> 01:33:37,211
SO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY, WHERE WAS

2052
01:33:35,008 --> 01:33:43,450
THE PLACE TO BE IN 1903 WHEN MY 

2053
01:33:37,277 --> 01:33:46,153
DAD WAS BORN IN 1903?

2054
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:52,826
THAT'S BIG NEWS.

2055
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:54,495
THIS HAS HAD A COUPLE OF TIMES 

2056
01:33:52,893 --> 01:33:57,031
BEFORE.

2057
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:58,565
HE WAS GREAT.

2058
01:33:57,098 --> 01:34:00,134
WITHOUT THE AUTOS, WE WOULDN'T 

2059
01:33:58,632 --> 01:34:03,671
HAVE GEICO.

2060
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:07,775
BUT IT TRANSFORMED THE COUNTRY.

2061
01:34:03,738 --> 01:34:08,676
AND HENRY FORD BROUGHT IN THE $5

2062
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:10,444
DAILY WAGE.

2063
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:14,748
THAT WAS A HUGE THING.

2064
01:34:10,511 --> 01:34:16,016
SIMPLY LINES OUT THE WHOLE 

2065
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,350
THING.

2066
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:18,485
A

2067
01:34:16,416 --> 01:34:22,389
AUTO, LET'S JUST ASSUME THAT YOU

2068
01:34:18,552 --> 01:34:30,531
HAD SEEN A QUICK GLANCE BACK IN 

2069
01:34:22,456 --> 01:34:30,898
1903 AFTER YOU WILL THE EE 

2070
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:32,666
FINANCE.

2071
01:34:30,965 --> 01:34:34,101
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT SAID, WELL, 

2072
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:35,269
THIS IS PRETTY EASY.

2073
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:39,473
IT'S GOING TO BE CARS.

2074
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:43,777
IT'S GOING TO BE AUTOS.

2075
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:45,379
WELL, BERKSHIRE ZSH LET'S SEE 

2076
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:47,614
WHAT WE'VE GOT UP THERE.

2077
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:48,081
YEAH, NO, STAY WHERE YOU WERE.

2078
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:54,088
GO BACK.

2079
01:34:48,148 --> 01:34:54,255
I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE SLIDES 

2080
01:34:54,155 --> 01:34:56,323
YET.

2081
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:57,758
GO BACK.

2082
01:34:56,390 --> 01:35:01,128
BERKSHIRE BY ACCIDENT -- WELL, 

2083
01:34:57,825 --> 01:35:05,065
WE OWN A COMPANY CALLED MARMON.

2084
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:06,700
WE BOUGHT IT SOME YEARS AGO.

2085
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:08,602
PRITZKERS HAD BUILT THIS 

2086
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:10,470
BUSINESS FROM MANY, MANY, MANY 

2087
01:35:08,669 --> 01:35:12,873
COMPANIES THAT THEY HAD ACQUIRED

2088
01:35:10,537 --> 01:35:14,842
AND THE NAME OF THEIR COMPANY 

2089
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:19,146
WAS CALLED MARMOM.

2090
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:21,882
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY THEY 

2091
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:31,091
DECIDED TO NAME IT MARMAN, BUT 

2092
01:35:21,948 --> 01:35:31,391
THEY DID OWN A COMPANY CALLED 

2093
01:35:31,158 --> 01:35:35,962
HARMON.

2094
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:37,464
THE MARMON COMPANY -- GETTING 

2095
01:35:36,029 --> 01:35:41,268
SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF ME ON THE 

2096
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:43,670
SLIDES AGAIN BUT THAT'S OKAY.

2097
01:35:41,335 --> 01:35:47,107
WE CALLED IT -- IT WAS -- THEY 

2098
01:35:43,737 --> 01:35:53,480
OWNED THIS COMPANY, MARMON, 

2099
01:35:47,174 --> 01:35:57,851
WHICH IN 1911 HAD BEEN A -- THE 

2100
01:35:53,547 --> 01:35:58,652
COMPANY WHOSE CAR WON THE FIRST 

2101
01:35:57,918 --> 01:36:00,321
INDIANAPOLIS 500.

2102
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:02,422
MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY CALLED 

2103
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:05,458
THEM MARMON.

2104
01:36:02,489 --> 01:36:14,168
THEY FOUNDED THE COMPANY THEN 

2105
01:36:05,525 --> 01:36:14,368
AND WON THE FIRST INDIANAPOLIS 

2106
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:20,173
500. 

2107
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:21,842
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT WAS A BIG 

2108
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:24,211
CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY.

2109
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:26,847
THE CAR THAT WAS ENTERED IN THE 

2110
01:36:24,278 --> 01:36:30,317
INDIANAPOLIS 500, THE GUY WHO 

2111
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:32,285
SATURDAY NEXT TO HIM AND LOOKED 

2112
01:36:30,384 --> 01:36:33,220
BACKWARDS, THEY INVENTED THE 

2113
01:36:32,352 --> 01:36:37,390
REAR-VIEW MIRROR.

2114
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:39,459
LET'S JUST ASSUME THAT THEY 

2115
01:36:37,457 --> 01:36:41,661
DECIDED THAT AUTOS WERE THIS 

2116
01:36:39,526 --> 01:36:43,397
INCREDIBLE THING AND SOME DAY 

2117
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:46,266
THERE WOULD BE AN INDIANAPOLIS 

2118
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:51,438
500, THEY WOULD HAVE REAR VIEW 

2119
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:54,441
MIRRORS AND 290 MILLION CARS 

2120
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:58,445
WOULD BE BUZZING.

2121
01:36:54,508 --> 01:37:03,650
AND SO I DECIDED TO LOOK AT THE 

2122
01:36:58,512 --> 01:37:08,688
HISTORY AND I THOUGHT I PUT UP A

2123
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:10,090
LIST FROM THE -- AND I WAS 

2124
01:37:08,755 --> 01:37:12,259
ORIGINALLY GOING TO PUT UP THE 

2125
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:15,062
Ms SO I COULD GET THEM ON ONE 

2126
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:18,699
SLIDE BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE Ms,

2127
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:20,433
I WENT ON AND ON AND ON.

2128
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:21,435
I DECIDED TO PUT UP ONES THAT 

2129
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:25,705
STARTED WITH MA.

2130
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:29,943
AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE WERE 

2131
01:37:25,772 --> 01:37:36,350
ALMOST 40 COMPANIES THAT WENT 

2132
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:36,750
INTO THE AUTO BUSINESS.

2133
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:39,186
MA.

2134
01:37:36,817 --> 01:37:46,159
MARCHMAN PRODUCT.

2135
01:37:39,253 --> 01:37:49,462
1930s WERE REALLY QUITE SPECIAL.

2136
01:37:46,226 --> 01:37:53,299
THERE WERE AT LEAST 2,000 

2137
01:37:49,529 --> 01:37:57,537
COMPANIES THAT ENTERED THE AUTO 

2138
01:37:53,366 --> 01:37:58,772
BUSINESS BECAUSE IT CLEARLY HAD 

2139
01:37:57,604 --> 01:38:03,110
THIS INCREDIBLE FUTURE.

2140
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:05,045
OF COURSE, YOU REMEMBER THAT IN 

2141
01:38:03,177 --> 01:38:06,647
2009 THERE WERE THREE LEFT, TWO 

2142
01:38:05,112 --> 01:38:10,784
OF WHICH WENT BANKRUPT.

2143
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:13,987
SO THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO 

2144
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:18,491
PICKING STOCKS THAN TRYING TO 

2145
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:22,496
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING TO BE A 

2146
01:38:18,558 --> 01:38:24,464
WONDERFUL FUTURE THE MAIN 

2147
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:25,399
STREET -- THERE WAS NEBRASKA 

2148
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:27,067
MOTOR COMPANY.

2149
01:38:25,466 --> 01:38:28,335
EVERYBODY STARTED CAR COMPANIES 

2150
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:30,103
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY IS STARTING 

2151
01:38:28,402 --> 01:38:33,573
SOMETHING NOW WHERE YOU CAN GET 

2152
01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:37,410
MONEY FROM PEOPLE.

2153
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:38,645
BUT THERE WERE VERY, VERY, VERY 

2154
01:38:37,477 --> 01:38:40,313
FEW PEOPLE THAT PICKED THE 

2155
01:38:38,712 --> 01:38:41,581
WINNER AND GOT THE OPPORTUNITY 

2156
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:43,717
AT FORD MOTOR.

2157
01:38:41,648 --> 01:38:45,319
HENRY FORD HAD A FEW PARTNERS 

2158
01:38:43,784 --> 01:38:49,523
THAT HE DIDN'T LIKE AND HE 

2159
01:38:45,386 --> 01:38:52,959
FIGURED, WAY TO BUY THEM OUT.

2160
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:56,062
THAT WAS SORT OF THE -- IT WAS 

2161
01:38:53,026 --> 01:38:59,333
SORT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE 

2162
01:38:56,129 --> 01:39:02,869
AUTO FINANCE.

2163
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:11,378
THAT'S A LONG STORY.

2164
01:39:02,936 --> 01:39:13,413
>> GENERAL MOTORS BECAME THE 

2165
01:39:11,445 --> 01:39:16,216
DOMINANT COMPANY.

2166
01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:17,818
THEY SHIFTED FROM THE MODEL T TO

2167
01:39:16,282 --> 01:39:19,552
THE MODEL A VERY QUICKLY.

2168
01:39:17,885 --> 01:39:21,188
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, IT'S 

2169
01:39:19,619 --> 01:39:26,359
NOT AS EASY AS THAT SOUNDS.

2170
01:39:21,255 --> 01:39:30,964
WITH THAT, WE WILL GO TO BECKY 

2171
01:39:26,426 --> 01:39:33,233
QUICK AND SHE WILL ASK ANY OF 

2172
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:34,801
THE FOUR OF US QUESTIONS SHE HAS

2173
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:41,842
SELECTED AND WHICH WE DON'T -- 

2174
01:39:34,868 --> 01:39:44,444
SHE DOESN'T SHARE WITH US AND WE

2175
01:39:41,909 --> 01:39:45,379
WILL DO THAT FOR A CONSIDERABLE 

2176
01:39:44,511 --> 01:39:46,546
PERIOD OF TIME.

2177
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:51,484
YOU CAN BE SENDING IN QUESTIONS 

2178
01:39:46,613 --> 01:39:53,486
TO HER AND THEN LATER ON AFTER 

2179
01:39:51,551 --> 01:39:54,954
ABOUT 3 1/2 HOURS WE WILL HAVE 

2180
01:39:53,553 --> 01:39:56,123
THE ANNUAL MEETING WHICH WON'T 

2181
01:39:55,021 --> 01:39:56,756
TAKE LONG.

2182
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:58,191
BECKY, OVER TO YOU. 

2183
01:39:56,823 --> 01:39:59,359
>> THANKS, WARREN.

2184
01:39:58,258 --> 01:40:01,061
HELLO TO EVERYBODY.

2185
01:39:59,426 --> 01:40:03,263
THIS FIRST QUESTION THAT CAME IN

2186
01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:06,666
CAME IN FROM ANDY SEAS.

2187
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:07,634
HE SAID HE'S THE OWNER OF NOT 

2188
01:40:06,733 --> 01:40:11,871
NEARLY ENOUGH B SHARES.

2189
01:40:07,701 --> 01:40:14,040
MR. BUFFETT, YOU'RE WELL KNOWN 

2190
01:40:11,938 --> 01:40:18,578
TO SAY BE FEARFUL WHEN OTHER 

2191
01:40:14,107 --> 01:40:19,780
PEOPLE ARE GREEDY.

2192
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:21,515
DUMPING AIRLINE STOCKS AT OR 

2193
01:40:19,846 --> 01:40:22,916
NEAR THE LOW, NOT TAKING 

2194
01:40:21,581 --> 01:40:25,018
ADVANTAGE OF THE FEAR OF 

2195
01:40:22,983 --> 01:40:33,193
GRIPPING THE MARKET TO BUY 

2196
01:40:25,085 --> 01:40:36,296
SHARES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES AND 

2197
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:38,932
BEING INFLEXIBLE.

2198
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:39,533
BERKSHIRE APPROACHED THE 

2199
01:40:38,999 --> 01:40:41,568
DECISION MAKING SPECIFICALLY 

2200
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,303
AFTER IT WAS ASSURED THROUGH THE

2201
01:40:41,635 --> 01:40:47,107
C.A.R.E.S. ACT IT WOULD PROVIDE 

2202
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:47,340
A ROBUST BACKSTOP IN THE 

2203
01:40:47,174 --> 01:40:49,109
MARKETS.

2204
01:40:47,407 --> 01:40:53,046
>> UNTIL BOTH MONETARY AND 

2205
01:40:49,176 --> 01:41:00,587
FISCAL POLICY KICKED IN -- WELL,

2206
01:40:53,113 --> 01:41:03,089
WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE PROBLEM.

2207
01:41:00,654 --> 01:41:05,291
JUST AS CHARLIE IS THE CHIEF 

2208
01:41:03,156 --> 01:41:06,260
CULTURE OFFICER, I'M CHIEF RISK 

2209
01:41:05,358 --> 01:41:07,027
OFFICER AT BERKSHIRE.

2210
01:41:06,326 --> 01:41:09,295
THAT'S MY JOB.

2211
01:41:07,094 --> 01:41:11,864
WE HOPE WE DO WELL BUT WE WANT 

2212
01:41:09,362 --> 01:41:13,867
TO BE SURE WE DON'T DO TERRIBLY.

2213
01:41:11,931 --> 01:41:18,037
BUT WE DIDN'T SELL A 

2214
01:41:13,934 --> 01:41:20,306
SUBSTANTIAL -- WE'RE A COMPANY 

2215
01:41:18,104 --> 01:41:22,142
WITH 6, PROBABLY $700 BILLION 

2216
01:41:20,373 --> 01:41:24,210
WORTH OF BUSINESSES, SOME WE OWN

2217
01:41:22,209 --> 01:41:24,811
IN THEIR ENTIRETY, SOME WE OWN A

2218
01:41:24,277 --> 01:41:27,514
PIECE OF.

2219
01:41:24,877 --> 01:41:29,683
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE WERE

2220
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:34,054
SELLERS IN MAYBE 1% OF THE VALUE

2221
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:36,256
OF ALL THE BUSINESSES WE HAD BUT

2222
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:37,190
JUST GOT TO MENTION THE AIRLINE 

2223
01:41:36,323 --> 01:41:40,360
BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR AND 

2224
01:41:37,257 --> 01:41:42,062
THEN I'LL GET ON WITH WHAT WAS 

2225
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:45,698
DONE IN FISCAL MONETARY POLICY.

2226
01:41:42,129 --> 01:41:48,301
WE HAD A FEW PEOPLE, VARIOUS 

2227
01:41:45,765 --> 01:41:51,738
AREAS OF BERKSHIRE, THAT WANTED 

2228
01:41:48,368 --> 01:41:54,874
TO GO IN FOR HELP FROM THE 

2229
01:41:51,805 --> 01:41:56,843
GOVERNMENT AND IN SOME CASES 

2230
01:41:54,941 --> 01:41:58,945
THEY HAD MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS 

2231
01:41:56,910 --> 01:42:02,248
OWNING A FEW PERCENT.

2232
01:41:59,012 --> 01:42:04,317
WE'RE GOING TO GET KILLED BY 

2233
01:42:02,315 --> 01:42:07,053
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE 

2234
01:42:04,384 --> 01:42:08,421
REGULATIONS THAT ARE BEING PUT 

2235
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,756
OUT STOPPING THE ECONOMY.

2236
01:42:08,488 --> 01:42:13,026
THEY SAID, EVERYBODY'S GOING IN 

2237
01:42:09,822 --> 01:42:16,263
FOR THEM, WHY DON'T WE GO IN?

2238
01:42:13,093 --> 01:42:19,499
I SAID, BERKSHIRE CAN HANDLE IT.

2239
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:22,802
THIS IS FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN'T 

2240
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:24,337
HANDLE IT SO WE'RE NOT APPLYING 

2241
01:42:22,869 --> 01:42:27,907
FOR IT.

2242
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:33,413
THE AIRLINES WERE THE MOST 

2243
01:42:27,974 --> 01:42:38,485
PROMINENT BENEFICIARIES OF WHAT 

2244
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:41,855
TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AT THIS.

2245
01:42:38,552 --> 01:42:46,560
GRANTS NOT LOANS.

2246
01:42:41,922 --> 01:42:46,793
AND I THINK THAT WAS FINE PUBLIC

2247
01:42:46,627 --> 01:42:50,863
POLICY.

2248
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:51,931
I WISH IT COULD GO TO EVERY pRE 

2249
01:42:50,930 --> 01:42:53,533
BUSINESS THAT WAS OUT OF 

2250
01:42:51,998 --> 01:42:55,301
BUSINESS AND HAD NO -- THEY 

2251
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:58,838
WERE -- THEY WERE -- THEY WERE 

2252
01:42:55,368 --> 01:43:00,006
MADE TOAST OF BASICALLY, BUT THE

2253
01:42:58,905 --> 01:43:02,375
AIRLINES CLEARLY WHAT HAPPENED 

2254
01:43:00,073 --> 01:43:03,843
WAS NOT THEIR FAULT IN ANY WAY, 

2255
01:43:02,442 --> 01:43:11,684
SHAPE, OR FORM.

2256
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:14,487
IT WASN'T LIKE IN 2008-2009 -- 

2257
01:43:11,751 --> 01:43:15,088
>> NOW AIRLINES OPERATE IN 

2258
01:43:14,554 --> 01:43:17,056
BANKRUPTCY.

2259
01:43:15,155 --> 01:43:18,157
THREE OF THE FOUR VICTIMS WENT 

2260
01:43:17,123 --> 01:43:21,227
THROUGH A BANKRUPTCY.

2261
01:43:18,224 --> 01:43:26,499
THE AIRLINES WERE BECOMING USED 

2262
01:43:21,294 --> 01:43:28,735
TO OPERATING IN -- IT WAS 

2263
01:43:26,566 --> 01:43:29,436
PERFECTLY PROPER FOR THE AIRLINE

2264
01:43:28,802 --> 01:43:31,271
INDUSTRY.

2265
01:43:29,503 --> 01:43:32,305
YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURES OF 2 

2266
01:43:31,338 --> 01:43:34,140
TRILLION FOR APPLE.

2267
01:43:32,372 --> 01:43:37,277
THE ENTIRE BIG FOUR AIRLINES, 

2268
01:43:34,207 --> 01:43:38,645
THEY WERE -- THEY SOLD FOR ABOUT

2269
01:43:37,344 --> 01:43:40,080
$100 BILLION ALMOST.

2270
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:40,913
VERY, VERY SMALL.

2271
01:43:40,147 --> 01:43:43,416
COMBINED THEY WOULDN'T COME 

2272
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:45,084
CLOSE TO MAKING THE CUT.

2273
01:43:43,483 --> 01:43:45,885
I MEAN, THEY WOULDN'T BE IN THE 

2274
01:43:45,151 --> 01:43:47,988
TOP 50.

2275
01:43:45,952 --> 01:43:48,288
SO, ANYWAY, THEY WENT INTO THE 

2276
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:49,622
GOVERNMENT.

2277
01:43:48,355 --> 01:43:53,760
THEY NEEDED THE GOVERNMENT HELP 

2278
01:43:49,689 --> 01:43:58,231
OR THEY NEEDED -- OR THEY WOULD 

2279
01:43:53,827 --> 01:44:00,967
GO BANKRUPT, SOME OF THEM.

2280
01:43:58,298 --> 01:44:03,170
AND REALLY CONGRESS AND STEVE 

2281
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:05,238
MNUCHIN TOO, THEY DECIDED THEY 

2282
01:44:03,236 --> 01:44:08,642
DESERVED HELP, WHICH I DO NOT 

2283
01:44:05,305 --> 01:44:11,745
QUARREL WITH AT ALL, BUT IMAGINE

2284
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:14,147
IF BERKSHIRE WAS THE 10% HOLDER,

2285
01:44:11,812 --> 01:44:15,815
WHICH THEY HAD BEEN.

2286
01:44:14,214 --> 01:44:19,319
BERKSHIRE, IT WOULD BE LIKE ONE 

2287
01:44:15,882 --> 01:44:21,254
OF OUR -- THEY MIGHT VERY WELL 

2288
01:44:19,386 --> 01:44:22,656
HAVE HAD A VERY, VERY, VERY 

2289
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:26,192
DIFFERENT RESULT IF THEY HAD HAD

2290
01:44:22,723 --> 01:44:29,095
A VERY, VERY, VERY RICH 

2291
01:44:26,259 --> 01:44:33,199
SHAREHOLDER THAT OWNED 8 OR 9%.

2292
01:44:29,162 --> 01:44:34,634
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT.

2293
01:44:33,266 --> 01:44:35,402
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE 

2294
01:44:34,701 --> 01:44:37,203
SAME RESULT.

2295
01:44:35,469 --> 01:44:38,838
IN FACT, YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T.

2296
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:40,440
I CAN SEE THE HEADLINES BECAUSE 

2297
01:44:38,905 --> 01:44:42,242
YOU'VE SEEN THE HEADLINES ON 

2298
01:44:40,507 --> 01:44:43,810
SOME COMPANIES THAT TOOK 100 

2299
01:44:42,309 --> 01:44:45,178
MILLION, THE AIRLINE DIDN'T NEED

2300
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:50,684
IT, SOME OF THEM GAVE IT BACK.

2301
01:44:45,245 --> 01:44:52,419
MOST OF THEM GAVE IT BACK.

2302
01:44:50,751 --> 01:44:53,720
BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT A

2303
01:44:52,486 --> 01:44:54,788
DIFFERENT RESULT THAN IF WE HAD 

2304
01:44:53,787 --> 01:45:00,660
KEPT OUR STOCK.

2305
01:44:54,855 --> 01:45:03,963
BUT IN ANY EVENT, AN INDUSTRY 

2306
01:45:00,727 --> 01:45:05,432
THAT WAS SELLING FOR LESS THAN 

2307
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:07,633
$100 MILLION.

2308
01:45:05,499 --> 01:45:08,501
THEY LOST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT 

2309
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:12,872
OF MONEY.

2310
01:45:08,568 --> 01:45:16,476
THEY LOST PERSPECTIVE EARNING 

2311
01:45:12,939 --> 01:45:20,613
POWER.

2312
01:45:16,543 --> 01:45:29,255
I WOULD SAY THE ECONOMIC 

2313
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:33,927
RECOVERY HAS GONE FAR BETTER AND

2314
01:45:29,322 --> 01:45:36,196
I CUT BACK SOME OF THE BANK 

2315
01:45:33,994 --> 01:45:40,900
INVESTMENT.

2316
01:45:36,263 --> 01:45:46,873
BASICALLY OUR NET SALES WERE 

2317
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:48,741
1.5%.

2318
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:52,044
I CONSIDERED IT A GREAT MOMENT 

2319
01:45:48,808 --> 01:45:54,013
IN BERKSHIRE HISTORY BUT WE'VE 

2320
01:45:52,111 --> 01:45:55,381
GOT MORE NET WORTH THAN ANY 

2321
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,149
OTHER COMPANY IN THE UNITED 

2322
01:45:55,448 --> 01:46:00,353
STATES UNDER ACCOUNTING 

2323
01:45:56,216 --> 01:46:02,255
PRINCIPLES AND WE'VE GOT 6 OR 

2324
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:03,923
700 BILLION IN BUSINESSES AND AS

2325
01:46:02,322 --> 01:46:05,425
I THINK THE AIRLINE BUSINESSES 

2326
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:06,659
HAVE DONE BETTER BECAUSE WE SOLD

2327
01:46:05,492 --> 01:46:10,196
AND I WISH THEM WELL.

2328
01:46:06,726 --> 01:46:11,698
I STILL WOULDN'T WANT TO BUY THE

2329
01:46:10,263 --> 01:46:15,067
AIRLINE BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL.

2330
01:46:11,765 --> 01:46:19,272
PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO -- THEY 

2331
01:46:15,134 --> 01:46:21,107
WANT TO TRAVEL FOR PERSONAL 

2332
01:46:19,339 --> 01:46:22,208
REASONS AND BUSINESS TRAVEL IS 

2333
01:46:21,173 --> 01:46:24,010
THE OTHER THING.

2334
01:46:22,275 --> 01:46:25,011
WE'VE GOT A BIG EXPOSURE TO 

2335
01:46:24,077 --> 01:46:27,480
BUSINESS TRAVEL, OF COURSE, 

2336
01:46:25,077 --> 01:46:31,617
THROUGH THE FACT THAT WE OWN 19%

2337
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:33,085
OF AMERICAN EXPRESS AND WE OWN 

2338
01:46:31,684 --> 01:46:34,387
PRECISION GAS PARTS WHICH 

2339
01:46:33,152 --> 01:46:37,256
SERVICES THE AIR BUSINESS.

2340
01:46:34,454 --> 01:46:41,227
WE'VE STILL GOT A BIG BUSINESS 

2341
01:46:37,323 --> 01:46:42,262
INVESTMENT IN AIR TRAVEL, A BIG 

2342
01:46:41,294 --> 01:46:46,433
COMMITMENT TO IT.

2343
01:46:42,329 --> 01:46:48,067
WE WISH THE BIG 4 THE BEST AND I

2344
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,634
THINK OUR MANAGEMENT'S HAVE DONE

2345
01:46:48,134 --> 01:46:51,604
A VERY GOOD JOB DURING THIS 

2346
01:46:48,701 --> 01:46:53,673
PERIOD.

2347
01:46:51,671 --> 01:46:54,874
>> MORE SPECIFICALLY BEYOND THE 

2348
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:56,242
AIRLINES THOUGH, JUST THE IDEA 

2349
01:46:54,941 --> 01:46:58,010
THAT -- AND THIS CAME FROM 

2350
01:46:56,309 --> 01:47:03,583
SEVERAL QUESTIONS, TOO, 

2351
01:46:58,077 --> 01:47:06,686
INCLUDING ONE FROM CHRIS BLAINE.

2352
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:09,656
YOU SPENT YEARS INSISTING YOU 

2353
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:10,957
HAD YOUR ELEPHANT GUN READY.

2354
01:47:09,723 --> 01:47:13,326
YOU SAT ON YOUR HANDS.

2355
01:47:11,024 --> 01:47:13,593
PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT I

2356
01:47:13,393 --> 01:47:15,395
MISSED.

2357
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:18,097
>> I DIDN'T GET THE LAST PART.

2358
01:47:15,462 --> 01:47:18,431
>> PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND 

2359
01:47:18,164 --> 01:47:19,832
WHAT I MISSED.

2360
01:47:18,497 --> 01:47:20,700
WHY DIDN'T YOU USE MORE OF THE 

2361
01:47:19,899 --> 01:47:23,603
CASH AT HAND?

2362
01:47:20,767 --> 01:47:26,573
>> WELL, WE HAVE ABOUT -- OUR 

2363
01:47:23,669 --> 01:47:31,444
CASH ON HAND HAS BEEN ABOUT 15% 

2364
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:38,318
OF OUR VALUES OF OUR BUSINESSES 

2365
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:42,055
AND THAT'S A HEALTHY CHUNK.

2366
01:47:38,385 --> 01:47:46,059
I SAY I'LL NEVER GET BELOW 20 

2367
01:47:42,121 --> 01:47:50,430
BILLION BUT WE'RE GOING TO RAISE

2368
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:54,100
THE SIZE.

2369
01:47:50,497 --> 01:47:56,436
WE COULD HAVE DEPLOYED 50 OR 75 

2370
01:47:54,166 --> 01:48:00,640
BILLION AND RIGHT BEFORE THE FED

2371
01:47:56,503 --> 01:48:02,809
ACT -- I MEAN, AT A POINT WHERE 

2372
01:48:00,707 --> 01:48:04,443
THE CALLS WERE -- TWO CALLS CAME

2373
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:07,714
IN, BUT THERE WAS TWO OR THREE 

2374
01:48:04,510 --> 01:48:11,317
DAYS THAT NOTHING COULD HAPPEN.

2375
01:48:07,781 --> 01:48:13,253
WHEN JAY POWELL ACTED AS HE DID,

2376
01:48:11,384 --> 01:48:14,887
THAT WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

2377
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:18,824
I MEAN, I SHOULD SAY THE FED 

2378
01:48:14,954 --> 01:48:21,794
ACTED AS THEY DID, BUT THEY 

2379
01:48:18,891 --> 01:48:23,696
MOVED WITH SPEED AND A 

2380
01:48:21,861 --> 01:48:27,333
DECISIVENESS ON MARCH 23rd THAT 

2381
01:48:23,763 --> 01:48:29,001
CHANGED THE SITUATION WHERE THE 

2382
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:31,037
ECONOMY HAD STOPPED, THE 

2383
01:48:29,068 --> 01:48:31,471
GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET WAS EVEN 

2384
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,738
DISRUPTED.

2385
01:48:31,538 --> 01:48:36,909
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY PROBABLY 

2386
01:48:32,805 --> 01:48:40,346
COULD NOT HAVE GONE OUT WITH A 

2387
01:48:36,976 --> 01:48:42,281
DEBT OFFERING THE DAY BEFORE.

2388
01:48:40,413 --> 01:48:44,116
DIDN'T GET A LOT OF PUBLICITY, 

2389
01:48:42,348 --> 01:48:45,852
BUT THERE WAS A RUN ON MONEY 

2390
01:48:44,183 --> 01:48:46,119
MARKET FUNDS, VERY SUBSTANTIAL 

2391
01:48:45,919 --> 01:48:47,553
RUN.

2392
01:48:46,186 --> 01:48:48,788
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE 

2393
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:51,023
NUMBERS -- DAILY NUMBERS ON 

2394
01:48:48,855 --> 01:48:53,993
THAT, IT WAS A REPEAT OF 

2395
01:48:51,090 --> 01:48:56,329
SEPTEMBER 2008.

2396
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:58,698
AND THIS TIME I GIVE GREAT 

2397
01:48:56,396 --> 01:49:01,400
CREDIT TO WHAT BERNANKE AND 

2398
01:48:58,765 --> 01:49:03,736
PAULSEN DID, BUT THIS TIME THE 

2399
01:49:01,467 --> 01:49:05,338
FED KNEW THAT SAYING WHATEVER IT

2400
01:49:03,803 --> 01:49:07,006
TAKES AND SAYING IT AND 

2401
01:49:05,405 --> 01:49:09,775
DEMONSTRATING IT, WHICH THEY DID

2402
01:49:07,073 --> 01:49:11,310
ON MARCH 23rd, THEY TOOK A 

2403
01:49:09,842 --> 01:49:12,745
MARKET WHERE BERKSHIRE COULDN'T 

2404
01:49:11,377 --> 01:49:15,581
SELL BONDS ON THE DAY BEFORE AND

2405
01:49:12,812 --> 01:49:18,517
TURNED IT INTO ONE WHERE 

2406
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:23,155
CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES, A DAY OR 

2407
01:49:18,584 --> 01:49:24,657
TWO LATER, RECORD ISSUANCE OF 

2408
01:49:23,222 --> 01:49:27,794
CORPORATE DEBT.

2409
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:29,162
COMPANIES LOSING MONEY.

2410
01:49:27,861 --> 01:49:29,429
COMPANIES WERE CLOSED.

2411
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:31,197
WHATEVER.

2412
01:49:29,496 --> 01:49:31,965
IT WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC MOVE 

2413
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:33,633
THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE.

2414
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:35,801
AND AT THE TIME AS I REMEMBER 

2415
01:49:33,699 --> 01:49:37,970
THE CHAIRMAN SAYING, YOU KNOW, 

2416
01:49:35,868 --> 01:49:38,771
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE HELP ON THE 

2417
01:49:38,037 --> 01:49:41,807
FISCAL FRONT?

2418
01:49:38,838 --> 01:49:43,943
AND THEN CONGRESS ACTED VERY, 

2419
01:49:41,874 --> 01:49:46,245
VERY BIG AGAIN IN 2008 AND NINE,

2420
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:48,014
THEY ARGUED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WE 

2421
01:49:46,312 --> 01:49:52,118
DON'T WANT TO GIVE MONEY TO 

2422
01:49:48,081 --> 01:49:52,418
THOSE DIRTY BANKS, THAT SORT OF 

2423
01:49:52,185 --> 01:49:53,620
THING.

2424
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:54,120
THIS TIME THERE WAS NOBODY TO 

2425
01:49:53,687 --> 01:49:59,291
BLAME.

2426
01:49:54,187 --> 01:50:00,727
THEY SAW WHAT WAS NECESSARY AND 

2427
01:49:59,358 --> 01:50:02,294
CONGRESS RESPONDED IN A WAY THAT

2428
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:04,230
WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT DID THE 

2429
01:50:02,361 --> 01:50:06,032
JOB AND IT DID -- I THINK IT DID

2430
01:50:04,297 --> 01:50:09,369
A BETTER JOB THAN EITHER THE FED

2431
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:09,736
OR THE TREASURY OR ANYBODY 

2432
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:17,243
EXPECTED.

2433
01:50:09,803 --> 01:50:19,378
THIS ECONOMY RIGHT NOW IS -- 85%

2434
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:24,884
OF IT IS RUNNING IN SUPER HIGH 

2435
01:50:19,445 --> 01:50:26,085
GEAR AND PEOPLE CAN'T -- AND 

2436
01:50:24,951 --> 01:50:27,353
YOU'RE SEEING SOME INFLATION AND

2437
01:50:26,152 --> 01:50:29,389
ALL OF THAT.

2438
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:29,956
IT'S RESPONDED IN AN INCREDIBLE 

2439
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:32,091
WAY.

2440
01:50:30,023 --> 01:50:33,526
WE'VE LEARNED SOMETHING OUT OF 

2441
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:34,927
2008 AND 9 BUT I DON'T THINK IT 

2442
01:50:33,592 --> 01:50:35,160
WAS A SURE THING THAT WOULD 

2443
01:50:34,994 --> 01:50:39,031
HAPPEN.

2444
01:50:35,227 --> 01:50:40,666
THE ONE THING ABOUT BERKSHIRE, 

2445
01:50:39,098 --> 01:50:42,001
WE NEVER WANT -- WE DON'T WANT 

2446
01:50:40,733 --> 01:50:43,036
TO DEPEND ON ANYBODY.

2447
01:50:42,068 --> 01:50:44,904
WE'RE NOT A BANK.

2448
01:50:43,103 --> 01:50:46,472
WE CAN'T GO TO THE FEDERAL 

2449
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:48,641
RESERVE IF WE NEED MONEY.

2450
01:50:46,539 --> 01:50:51,343
WE'VE GOT TO BE SURE THAT UNDER 

2451
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:52,845
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, ANY 

2452
01:50:51,410 --> 01:51:00,886
CIRCUMSTANCES WE CAN'T SOLVE 

2453
01:50:52,912 --> 01:51:04,356
NUCLEAR WAR AND WE CAN'T -- BUT 

2454
01:51:00,953 --> 01:51:06,726
IN "A STREET CAR NAMED DESIRE" 

2455
01:51:04,423 --> 01:51:07,393
SAID I DEPEND ON THE KINDNESS OF

2456
01:51:06,793 --> 01:51:11,297
STRANGERS.

2457
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:12,465
YOU CAN'T DEPEND ON OTHERS IF 

2458
01:51:11,364 --> 01:51:13,733
THINGS ARE STOPPED.

2459
01:51:12,532 --> 01:51:14,567
WE WERE SEEING IT IN THE MIDDLE 

2460
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:16,002
OF MARCH.

2461
01:51:14,634 --> 01:51:16,669
EVERYBODY WAS DRAWING DOWN THEIR

2462
01:51:16,069 --> 01:51:18,805
CREDIT LINES.

2463
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:20,740
THE BANKS DID NOT EXPECT THAT.

2464
01:51:18,872 --> 01:51:22,441
THEY JUST WEREN'T SURE THEY WERE

2465
01:51:20,807 --> 01:51:24,343
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN 

2466
01:51:22,508 --> 01:51:24,543
THEIR CREDIT LINES TEN DAYS 

2467
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:25,812
LATER.

2468
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:29,382
THEY DREW THEM DOWN.

2469
01:51:25,879 --> 01:51:29,582
TOOK MONEY OUT OF MONEY MARKET 

2470
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:32,218
FUNDS.

2471
01:51:29,649 --> 01:51:34,020
WE GOT -- I GIVE GREAT CREDIT ON

2472
01:51:32,285 --> 01:51:34,754
THE MONETARY FISCAL SIDE WHAT 

2473
01:51:34,087 --> 01:51:35,955
WAS DONE.

2474
01:51:34,821 --> 01:51:36,956
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A SURE 

2475
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:38,758
THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

2476
01:51:37,023 --> 01:51:39,058
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD BE 

2477
01:51:38,825 --> 01:51:41,393
IMPLEMENTED.

2478
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:45,030
I THINK IT'S WORKED BETTER THAN 

2479
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:47,399
JUST ABOUT ANYBODY HAS EXPECTED 

2480
01:51:45,097 --> 01:51:50,636
AND I THINK -- WELL, YOU'RE 

2481
01:51:47,466 --> 01:51:51,837
SEEING IT NOW.

2482
01:51:50,703 --> 01:51:52,605
CHARLIE'S GOT SOME VIEWS ON 

2483
01:51:51,904 --> 01:51:54,240
THIS, TOO.

2484
01:51:52,672 --> 01:51:56,943
WE SHOULDN'T LEAVE HIM OUT OF 

2485
01:51:54,307 --> 01:52:02,581
IT.

2486
01:51:57,010 --> 01:52:04,850
>> WELL, IT'S CRAZY TO THINK 

2487
01:52:02,648 --> 01:52:06,218
ANYBODY IS GOING TO BE SMART 

2488
01:52:04,917 --> 01:52:08,921
ENOUGH TO HAVE MONEY AND COME 

2489
01:52:06,285 --> 01:52:10,490
OUT ON THE TAKE IN SOME CRAZY 

2490
01:52:08,988 --> 01:52:11,624
CRISIS AND SPEND IT ALL.

2491
01:52:10,557 --> 01:52:14,927
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME PERSON THAT 

2492
01:52:11,691 --> 01:52:15,962
DOES IT BY ACCIDENT BUT THAT'S 

2493
01:52:14,994 --> 01:52:17,563
TRUE TO STANDARD.

2494
01:52:16,029 --> 01:52:20,333
ANYBODY WHO EXPECTS THAT OF 

2495
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:20,533
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY IS OUT OF HIS

2496
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,767
MIND. 

2497
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:23,736
>> CHARLIE AND I WERE NEVER 

2498
01:52:21,834 --> 01:52:24,703
REALLY GOOD AT DANCING BUT WE 

2499
01:52:23,803 --> 01:52:26,839
CAN DO THAT DANCE. 

2500
01:52:24,770 --> 01:52:27,707
>> NO, WE CAN'T.

2501
01:52:26,906 --> 01:52:29,775
ALMOST NOBODY ELSE CAN. 

2502
01:52:27,774 --> 01:52:30,610
>> NOT WITH TENS OF BILLIONS OR 

2503
01:52:29,842 --> 01:52:32,645
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS.

2504
01:52:30,677 --> 01:52:35,514
BUT IT'S WORKED OUT WELL.

2505
01:52:32,712 --> 01:52:38,884
WE FORGOT TO SHOW ON THE 

2506
01:52:35,581 --> 01:52:40,286
FINANCIAL SIDE BACK TO THE 

2507
01:52:38,951 --> 01:52:42,021
BALANCE SHEET.

2508
01:52:40,353 --> 01:52:43,256
WE DID BUY IN.

2509
01:52:42,088 --> 01:52:45,457
YOU'LL SEE THE SHARES 

2510
01:52:43,323 --> 01:52:47,193
OUTSTANDING IF YOU GO BACK TO 

2511
01:52:45,524 --> 01:52:54,000
WHAT IS IT E-3. 

2512
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:56,602
>> E-2.

2513
01:52:54,067 --> 01:52:57,904
>> I THINK IT'S E-2.

2514
01:52:56,669 --> 01:52:59,839
THE BALANCE SHEET.

2515
01:52:57,971 --> 01:53:02,475
>> THERE IT SHOWS THE SHARES 

2516
01:52:59,906 --> 01:53:05,277
OUTSTANDING IN THE BOTTOM.

2517
01:53:02,542 --> 01:53:07,113
WE HAVE -- WE SPENT ABOUT 25 

2518
01:53:05,344 --> 01:53:09,182
BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND

2519
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:11,818
MORE MONEY SINCE THEN.

2520
01:53:09,249 --> 01:53:13,485
IT'S THE BEST THING.

2521
01:53:11,885 --> 01:53:15,054
WE CAN'T BUY COMPANIES AND WE 

2522
01:53:13,552 --> 01:53:18,758
CAN'T BUY STOCKS AS CHEAP AS WE 

2523
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:20,459
CAN BUY OUR OWN.

2524
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:23,930
WE'VE DONE THAT WITH A FAIR 

2525
01:53:20,526 --> 01:53:26,932
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

2526
01:53:23,997 --> 01:53:28,668
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, DEFINITELY WE 

2527
01:53:26,999 --> 01:53:32,271
COULD HAVE DONE BETTER THINGS.

2528
01:53:28,735 --> 01:53:34,173
WE WOULD HAVE SOLD -- WE WOULD 

2529
01:53:32,338 --> 01:53:35,474
HAVE SOLD AIRLINES AND CUT BACK 

2530
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:37,210
ON BANKS REGARDLESS.

2531
01:53:35,541 --> 01:53:38,611
WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT 

2532
01:53:37,276 --> 01:53:39,412
SOMETHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME 

2533
01:53:38,678 --> 01:53:40,947
IS ANOTHER QUESTION. 

2534
01:53:39,478 --> 01:53:42,448
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM A 

2535
01:53:41,014 --> 01:53:44,016
LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER WHO'S BEEN

2536
01:53:42,515 --> 01:53:45,785
HERE FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS.

2537
01:53:44,083 --> 01:53:48,154
HIS NAME IS BEN KNOLL.

2538
01:53:45,852 --> 01:53:48,421
HE'S FROM MINNEAPOLIS, 

2539
01:53:48,221 --> 01:53:50,590
MINNESOTA.

2540
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:52,224
HE SAYS, MR. MUNGER AND MR. 

2541
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:53,993
BUFFETT, AFTER A 15 YEAR PERIOD 

2542
01:53:52,291 --> 01:53:55,694
OF MARKET UNDER PERFORMANCE, 

2543
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:57,096
YOU'RE CAUTIOUS PREDICTING 

2544
01:53:55,761 --> 01:53:59,065
BERKSHIRE BEING ABLE TO 

2545
01:53:57,163 --> 01:53:59,298
OUTPERFORM THE MARKET IN THE 

2546
01:53:59,132 --> 01:54:00,466
FUTURE.

2547
01:53:59,365 --> 01:54:02,401
GIVEN THIS WHAT DO YOU SEE IS 

2548
01:54:00,533 --> 01:54:03,702
THE MARKETS OF LONG-TIMESHARE 

2549
01:54:02,468 --> 01:54:06,605
HOLDERS HOLDING THEIR STOCKS 

2550
01:54:03,769 --> 01:54:07,773
VERSUS DIVERSIFYING THEIR RISK 

2551
01:54:06,672 --> 01:54:09,575
ACROSS AN INDEX?

2552
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,775
>> CHARLIE, YOU WANT TO ANSWER 

2553
01:54:09,642 --> 01:54:10,643
THAT?

2554
01:54:09,842 --> 01:54:12,411
>> SURE.

2555
01:54:10,710 --> 01:54:16,716
WELL, I PERSONALLY PREFER 

2556
01:54:12,478 --> 01:54:21,621
HOLDING BERKSHIRE TO HOLDING THE

2557
01:54:16,783 --> 01:54:22,488
MARKET SO I'M QUITE COMFORTABLE 

2558
01:54:21,687 --> 01:54:24,189
HOLDING BERKSHIRE.

2559
01:54:22,555 --> 01:54:26,392
I THINK OUR BUSINESSES ARE 

2560
01:54:24,256 --> 01:54:27,793
BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE. 

2561
01:54:26,458 --> 01:54:29,462
>> IS IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK

2562
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:31,030
THE MARKET VALUES IT FAIRLY?

2563
01:54:29,529 --> 01:54:32,631
>> WELL, THESE ARE JUST 

2564
01:54:31,097 --> 01:54:35,034
ACCIDENTS OF HISTORY AND THINGS 

2565
01:54:32,698 --> 01:54:38,004
ARE FLUCTUATING AT ALL TIMES.

2566
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:39,105
ON A COMPOSITE BASIS, I'D BET ON

2567
01:54:38,071 --> 01:54:42,842
BERKSHIRE OVER THE MARKET.

2568
01:54:39,172 --> 01:54:44,977
THAT'S ASSUMING WE'RE ALL DEAD.

2569
01:54:42,909 --> 01:54:47,947
>> I RECOMMEND IT.

2570
01:54:45,044 --> 01:54:49,915
I RECOMMEND THE S&P 500 INDEX 

2571
01:54:48,014 --> 01:54:51,617
FUND AND HAVE FOR A LONG, LONG 

2572
01:54:49,982 --> 01:54:55,821
TIME TO PEOPLE.

2573
01:54:51,684 --> 01:54:57,523
AND I'VE NEVER RECOMMENDED 

2574
01:54:55,888 --> 01:54:59,458
BERKSHIRE TO ANYBODY BECAUSE I 

2575
01:54:57,589 --> 01:55:01,226
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BUY IT 

2576
01:54:59,525 --> 01:55:02,795
BECAUSE THEY THINK I'M TIPPING 

2577
01:55:01,293 --> 01:55:05,064
THEM -- NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS 

2578
01:55:02,862 --> 01:55:08,033
SELLING FOR.

2579
01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:12,905
AND, YOU KNOW, I MADE IT PUBLIC.

2580
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:16,208
ON MY DEATH THERE'S A FUND FOR 

2581
01:55:12,972 --> 01:55:18,711
MY -- THAT THEN WIDOW AND 90% 

2582
01:55:16,275 --> 01:55:21,047
WILL GO INTO AN S&P 500 INDEX 

2583
01:55:18,778 --> 01:55:23,082
FUND, 10% INTO TREASURY.

2584
01:55:21,114 --> 01:55:26,251
ON THE OTHER HAND, I'M VERY 

2585
01:55:23,149 --> 01:55:26,852
HAPPY HAVING MY FUTURE 

2586
01:55:26,318 --> 01:55:30,356
CONTRIBUTIONS TO A GROUP OF 

2587
01:55:26,919 --> 01:55:35,828
CHARITIES THAT WE SPREAD OVER.

2588
01:55:30,423 --> 01:55:37,230
I THINK THE ODDS ARE 

2589
01:55:35,895 --> 01:55:40,199
BERKSHIRE -- BERKSHIRE IS -- I 

2590
01:55:37,296 --> 01:55:45,204
LIKE IT BUT I'M NOT -- I 

2591
01:55:40,266 --> 01:55:47,906
DON'T -- I DO NOT THINK THE 

2592
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:49,775
AVERAGE PERSON CAN PICK STOCKS.

2593
01:55:47,973 --> 01:55:53,545
WE HAPPEN TO HAVE A LARGE GROUP 

2594
01:55:49,842 --> 01:55:54,414
OF PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T PICK 

2595
01:55:53,612 --> 01:55:57,282
STOCKS BUT THEY PICKED CHARLIE 

2596
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:58,451
AND ME TO MANAGE MONEY FOR THEM 

2597
01:55:57,349 --> 01:56:00,486
50, 60 YEARS AGO.

2598
01:55:58,518 --> 01:56:02,554
WE HAVE A VERY UNUSUAL GROUP OF 

2599
01:56:00,553 --> 01:56:06,558
SHARE HOLD I THINK WHO LOOK AT 

2600
01:56:02,621 --> 01:56:07,993
BERKSHIRE AS A LIFETIME SAVINGS 

2601
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:10,362
VEHICLE AND ONE THEY DON'T HAVE 

2602
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:11,864
TO THINK ABOUT AND ONE THAT 

2603
01:56:10,429 --> 01:56:15,067
THEY'LL -- YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T 

2604
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:17,102
LOOK AT IT AGAIN FOR 10 OR 20 

2605
01:56:15,134 --> 01:56:18,671
YEARS THAT WILL HAVE TAKEN CARE 

2606
01:56:17,169 --> 01:56:23,575
OF THE MONEY REASONABLY WELL.

2607
01:56:18,738 --> 01:56:24,677
I WOULDN'T ARGUE THE S&P 500 

2608
01:56:23,642 --> 01:56:29,481
OVER TIME.

2609
01:56:24,744 --> 01:56:31,016
I LIKE BERKSHIRE BUT I -- I 

2610
01:56:29,548 --> 01:56:34,653
THINK THAT THE PERSON WHO 

2611
01:56:31,083 --> 01:56:36,388
DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE 

2612
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:37,823
STOCKS AT ALL AND DOESN'T HAVE 

2613
01:56:36,455 --> 01:56:39,625
ANY SPECIAL FEELINGS ABOUT 

2614
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:42,461
BERKSHIRE, I THINK THEY OUGHT TO

2615
01:56:39,692 --> 01:56:46,232
BUY THE S&P 500 INDEX.

2616
01:56:42,528 --> 01:56:48,200
>> AS A FOLLOW-UP TO THAT, 

2617
01:56:46,299 --> 01:56:50,470
GERALD SILVER WRITES IN THE 

2618
01:56:48,267 --> 01:56:55,974
TRUSTEES TO YOUR STATE -- I 

2619
01:56:50,536 --> 01:56:57,343
BELIEVE YOU'VE DIRECTED THE 

2620
01:56:56,041 --> 01:56:58,944
MANAGERS TO INVEST IN THE FUND.

2621
01:56:57,410 --> 01:56:59,244
ISN'T THAT A VOTE OF NO 

2622
01:56:59,011 --> 01:57:00,979
CONFIDENCE?

2623
01:56:59,311 --> 01:57:02,748
>> NO, WE'RE TALKING WAY LESS 

2624
01:57:01,046 --> 01:57:04,917
THAN 1% OF MY ESTATE.

2625
01:57:02,815 --> 01:57:06,585
ONE THING I'M GOING TO DO, 

2626
01:57:04,984 --> 01:57:08,654
INCIDENTALLY -- ALL RICH PEOPLE 

2627
01:57:06,652 --> 01:57:10,256
GET ADVISED BY THEIR LAWYERS TO 

2628
01:57:08,721 --> 01:57:10,923
SET UP A TRUST SO NOBODY CAN SEE

2629
01:57:10,323 --> 01:57:13,025
YOUR WILL.

2630
01:57:10,990 --> 01:57:13,258
 MY WILL IS GOING TO BE PUBLIC 

2631
01:57:13,092 --> 01:57:14,960
RECORD.

2632
01:57:13,325 --> 01:57:16,295
YOU CAN CHECK AT SOME POINT IF 

2633
01:57:15,027 --> 01:57:19,432
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU THE TRUTH 

2634
01:57:16,362 --> 01:57:23,068
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO GET DONE.

2635
01:57:19,499 --> 01:57:26,205
99.7% ROUGHLY OF MY ESTATE WILL 

2636
01:57:23,135 --> 01:57:30,242
EITHER GO TO PHILANTHROPIES OR 

2637
01:57:26,272 --> 01:57:31,743
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND 

2638
01:57:30,309 --> 01:57:33,178
BEFORE IT DOES T I THINK 

2639
01:57:31,810 --> 01:57:33,913
BERKSHIRE IS A VERY GOOD THING 

2640
01:57:33,245 --> 01:57:37,516
TO HOLD.

2641
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:40,953
BUT FOR A GIVEN INDIVIDUAL, 

2642
01:57:37,583 --> 01:57:43,189
PARTICULARLY MY WIFE, I JUST 

2643
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:44,523
THINK THAT HAVING A TINY 

2644
01:57:43,256 --> 01:57:46,225
FRACTION, WHICH IS ALL IT TAKES 

2645
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:49,361
FOR HER TO DO VERY WELL FOR THE 

2646
01:57:46,292 --> 01:57:53,065
REST OF HER LIFE, I THINK THAT 

2647
01:57:49,428 --> 01:57:56,368
THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO BUY 

2648
01:57:53,132 --> 01:57:58,337
90% IN AN S&P 500 INDEX FUND.

2649
01:57:56,435 --> 01:58:02,541
NOW THE INDEX FUND PEOPLE 

2650
01:57:58,404 --> 01:58:04,676
NATURALLY HAVE STARTED OVER THE 

2651
01:58:02,608 --> 01:58:06,111
TIME THEY MARKET MORE AND MORE 

2652
01:58:04,743 --> 01:58:07,079
PRODUCTS THAT GO TO OTHER 

2653
01:58:06,178 --> 01:58:08,614
INDICES AND EVERYTHING.

2654
01:58:07,146 --> 01:58:09,982
THEY'RE REALLY STARTING TO SAY 

2655
01:58:08,681 --> 01:58:13,452
TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, THEY'RE 

2656
01:58:10,049 --> 01:58:15,821
SAYING, WELL, YOU CAN PICK WHAT 

2657
01:58:13,518 --> 01:58:16,088
TO INVEST IN AND WE'LL SELL YOU 

2658
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:18,590
SOMETHING.

2659
01:58:16,155 --> 01:58:21,727
WHEN THEY HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH, 

2660
01:58:18,657 --> 01:58:22,928
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING IN 

2661
01:58:21,794 --> 01:58:24,630
STOCKS.

2662
01:58:22,995 --> 01:58:28,367
SO I NAMED THE 500 INDEXES ONE 

2663
01:58:24,697 --> 01:58:30,269
BUT IT'S A TINY PORTION BUT IT 

2664
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:30,569
WILL BE -- IT WILL BE HER 

2665
01:58:30,336 --> 01:58:31,937
LIVELIHOOD.

2666
01:58:30,636 --> 01:58:34,039
SHE'LL HAVE ALL THE MONEY SHE 

2667
01:58:32,004 --> 01:58:35,107
NEEDS AND WAY BEYOND IT AND 

2668
01:58:34,106 --> 01:58:40,980
THAT'S THAT.

2669
01:58:35,174 --> 01:58:42,915
I DON'T MIND HAVING THE 99.7%.

2670
01:58:41,047 --> 01:58:48,854
A LARGE PORTION OF IT, ASSUMING 

2671
01:58:42,982 --> 01:58:50,322
THE LAW'S THE SAME AS NOW GO TO 

2672
01:58:48,921 --> 01:58:54,460
PHILANTHROPY, IT WILL BE KEPT IN

2673
01:58:50,389 --> 01:58:55,861
BERKSHIRE UNTIL THEY FINALLY ARE

2674
01:58:54,527 --> 01:58:57,663
DISPOSED OF.

2675
01:58:55,928 --> 01:58:58,797
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM 

2676
01:58:57,730 --> 01:59:00,532
ANDREW DICKSON IN THE U.K.

2677
01:58:58,864 --> 01:59:02,334
HE SAYS, MY QUESTION IS IN 

2678
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:03,702
RELATION TO THE OIL AND GAS 

2679
01:59:02,401 --> 01:59:04,370
BUSINESS AND YOUR PURCHASE OF 

2680
01:59:03,769 --> 01:59:06,238
CHEVRON STOCK.

2681
01:59:04,437 --> 01:59:08,207
WHEN BEING ASKED A QUESTION ON 

2682
01:59:06,305 --> 01:59:09,141
TOBACCO STOCKS IN 1997 YOU 

2683
01:59:08,274 --> 01:59:11,009
MENTIONED THAT INDIVIDUALS AND 

2684
01:59:09,208 --> 01:59:12,144
COMPANIES OCCASIONALLY HAVE TO 

2685
01:59:11,076 --> 01:59:12,945
DRAW MORAL LINES ABOUT WHAT 

2686
01:59:12,211 --> 01:59:14,547
THEY'RE WILLING TO DO.

2687
01:59:13,012 --> 01:59:16,315
YOU STATED AT THE TIME THAT YOU 

2688
01:59:14,613 --> 01:59:18,217
WERE NOT COMFORTABLE IN MAKING A

2689
01:59:16,382 --> 01:59:19,852
BIG COMMITMENT IN TOBACCO STOCKS

2690
01:59:18,284 --> 01:59:21,020
AND YOU WERE UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT

2691
01:59:19,919 --> 01:59:22,588
THEIR PROSPECTS.

2692
01:59:21,087 --> 01:59:24,489
CHARLIE HAS ALSO REFERENCED 

2693
01:59:22,654 --> 01:59:25,757
PASSING ON A PRIVATE TOBACCO 

2694
01:59:24,556 --> 01:59:27,760
DEAL THAT YOU KNEW WAS A CINCH 

2695
01:59:25,824 --> 01:59:28,561
AND YOU HAD NO REGRETS SAYING NO

2696
01:59:27,827 --> 01:59:30,563
TO THE TRANSACTION.

2697
01:59:28,628 --> 01:59:32,130
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE OIL 

2698
01:59:30,629 --> 01:59:34,767
AND GAS BUSINESS HAS THE SAME 

2699
01:59:32,197 --> 01:59:36,302
KNOWN NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES AS 

2700
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:37,736
CIGARETTES, THEY DO NOT.

2701
01:59:36,369 --> 01:59:39,939
WITH TOBACCO THE CAUSE AND 

2702
01:59:37,803 --> 01:59:40,339
EFFECT IS DIRECT, OBVIOUS AND 

2703
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:42,841
MEASURABLE.

2704
01:59:40,406 --> 01:59:45,544
WITH HYDROCARBONS THE SOCIETAL 

2705
01:59:42,908 --> 01:59:46,912
COSTS AN BENEFITS ARE FAR MORE 

2706
01:59:45,611 --> 01:59:49,148
COMPLEX TO DEBATE.

2707
01:59:46,979 --> 01:59:50,916
IT'S DRAWING THEIR LINES IN SUCH

2708
01:59:49,214 --> 01:59:52,551
A WAY THAT THEIR PAINTING DOES 

2709
01:59:50,983 --> 01:59:52,851
NOT INCLUDE HYDROCARBONS, 

2710
01:59:52,618 --> 01:59:56,755
PERIOD.

2711
01:59:52,918 --> 01:59:59,458
 MY QUESTION IS AS THE ALARMISM 

2712
01:59:56,822 --> 02:00:01,894
FROM THE CLIMATE COMMUNITY 

2713
01:59:59,525 --> 02:00:08,200
BECOME PERVASIVE ENOUGH TO WHERE

2714
02:00:01,961 --> 02:00:10,937
IT'S IRRATIONAL.

2715
02:00:08,267 --> 02:00:12,671
IS THIS BECOMING AN OVERLY 

2716
02:00:11,003 --> 02:00:14,974
EXPENSIVE TASK?

2717
02:00:12,738 --> 02:00:16,708
CAN WE GATHER FROM YOUR PURCHASE

2718
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:17,943
OF CHEVRON STOCK YOU DO NOT 

2719
02:00:16,775 --> 02:00:19,911
BELIEVE THE HOWLING FROM 

2720
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:23,282
SOCIETY, REGULATORS AND 

2721
02:00:19,978 --> 02:00:24,850
POLITICIANS WILL IMPACT AND 

2722
02:00:23,349 --> 02:00:29,255
CHEVRON FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS?

2723
02:00:24,917 --> 02:00:30,989
CAN CONSUMERS ASSUME THIS CAN 

2724
02:00:29,321 --> 02:00:35,127
GENERATE A SUFFICIENT RETURN ON 

2725
02:00:31,056 --> 02:00:37,563
CAPITAL FOR A LONG TIME TO COME?

2726
02:00:35,194 --> 02:00:42,601
>> WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU A 

2727
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:43,636
TEN-WORD ANSWER TO THAT.

2728
02:00:42,668 --> 02:00:44,870
I CAN'T REMEMBER ALL OF THE 

2729
02:00:43,702 --> 02:00:46,204
QUESTIONS THAT WERE THERE, BUT I

2730
02:00:44,937 --> 02:00:48,206
WOULD SAY THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE 

2731
02:00:46,271 --> 02:00:51,710
ON THE EXTREMES OF BOTH SIDES 

2732
02:00:48,273 --> 02:00:54,046
ARE A LITTLE NUTS.

2733
02:00:51,777 --> 02:00:55,414
I WOULD HATE TO HAVE ALL THE 

2734
02:00:54,113 --> 02:00:55,948
HYDROCARBONS BANNED IN THREE 

2735
02:00:55,481 --> 02:00:57,449
YEARS.

2736
02:00:56,015 --> 02:00:59,117
YOU KNOW, YOU WOULDN'T WANT A 

2737
02:00:57,516 --> 02:01:01,887
WORLD -- IT WOULDN'T WORK AND ON

2738
02:00:59,184 --> 02:01:03,322
THE OTHER HAND, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S

2739
02:01:01,954 --> 02:01:05,891
HAPPENING WILL BE ADAPTED TO 

2740
02:01:03,389 --> 02:01:10,229
OVER TIME JUST AS WE'VE ADAPTED 

2741
02:01:05,958 --> 02:01:11,830
TO ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

2742
02:01:10,296 --> 02:01:12,231
I'M INTERESTED IN THE QUOTE FROM

2743
02:01:11,897 --> 02:01:13,232
1997.

2744
02:01:12,298 --> 02:01:15,868
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE.

2745
02:01:13,299 --> 02:01:19,571
WE HAVE NO PROBLEM OWNING COSTCO

2746
02:01:15,935 --> 02:01:21,840
OR WALMART AND A SUBSTANTIAL 

2747
02:01:19,638 --> 02:01:23,976
NUMBER OF THEIR STORES.

2748
02:01:21,907 --> 02:01:26,178
YOU KNOW, THEY SELL CIGARETTES.

2749
02:01:24,043 --> 02:01:26,878
BIG ITEM.

2750
02:01:26,245 --> 02:01:27,446
IT'S SOMETHING THAT BRINGS 

2751
02:01:26,945 --> 02:01:30,649
PEOPLE IN.

2752
02:01:27,513 --> 02:01:33,319
THEY KNOW THE PRICE OF 

2753
02:01:30,715 --> 02:01:34,053
CIGARETTES AND THEY PUT THEM OUT

2754
02:01:33,386 --> 02:01:35,421
FRONT.

2755
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:37,089
IT'S A VERY TOUGH SITUATION.

2756
02:01:35,487 --> 02:01:39,592
WE MADE THAT DECISION A LONG 

2757
02:01:37,156 --> 02:01:40,893
TIME AGO WHEN WE WENT TO MEMPHIS

2758
02:01:39,658 --> 02:01:43,095
AND WE LOOKED AT A BUSINESS THAT

2759
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:44,996
WAS A VERY, VERY GOOD BUSINESS.

2760
02:01:43,162 --> 02:01:46,398
IT WAS MUCH LESS HARMFUL, AT 

2761
02:01:45,063 --> 02:01:47,599
LEAST FROM EVERYTHING I COULD 

2762
02:01:46,465 --> 02:01:51,970
FIND OUT.

2763
02:01:47,666 --> 02:01:53,372
IT WAS MUCH LESS HARMFUL THAN 

2764
02:01:52,037 --> 02:01:53,639
SMOKING TOBACCO, CHEWING TOBACCO

2765
02:01:53,439 --> 02:01:54,873
WAS.

2766
02:01:53,706 --> 02:01:56,408
THESE WERE DECENT PEOPLE.

2767
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:58,243
THEY WERE RUNNING A LEGAL 

2768
02:01:56,475 --> 02:01:59,010
BUSINESS AND THEY ALL CHEWED 

2769
02:01:58,310 --> 02:02:00,545
TOBACCO THEMSELVES.

2770
02:01:59,077 --> 02:02:02,647
THEY TOLD ME THAT THEIR MOTHER 

2771
02:02:00,612 --> 02:02:03,782
WAS 100 AND CHEWING TOBACCO AND 

2772
02:02:02,714 --> 02:02:05,584
ALL OF THESE THINGS.

2773
02:02:03,849 --> 02:02:07,919
CHARLIE AND I DID GO DOWN IN THE

2774
02:02:05,651 --> 02:02:09,588
LOBBY OF THAT HOTEL AND WE JUST 

2775
02:02:07,986 --> 02:02:10,823
SAID TO OURSELVES, THIS IS 

2776
02:02:09,655 --> 02:02:11,790
PROBABLY THE BEST BUSINESS WE'VE

2777
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:14,860
EVER SEEN.

2778
02:02:11,857 --> 02:02:17,062
I CALLED MY THEN SON-IN-LAW, HE 

2779
02:02:14,927 --> 02:02:19,932
HAD STUDIED CHEWING TOBACCO AND 

2780
02:02:17,129 --> 02:02:21,700
ITS EFFECTS WHEN HE WAS WORKING 

2781
02:02:19,998 --> 02:02:26,872
FOR A NADER RELATED ORGANIZATION

2782
02:02:21,767 --> 02:02:29,208
AND WE DECIDED NOT TO DO IT.

2783
02:02:26,939 --> 02:02:31,343
YOU KNOW, I SEE -- I USED TO SEE

2784
02:02:29,275 --> 02:02:32,978
ADS IN OUR PAPER FROM FINANCIAL 

2785
02:02:31,410 --> 02:02:33,679
COMPANIES WHERE I KNEW THEY WERE

2786
02:02:33,045 --> 02:02:37,383
TERRIBLE.

2787
02:02:33,746 --> 02:02:38,517
IT'S A VERY TOUGH THING TO 

2788
02:02:37,449 --> 02:02:39,385
DECIDE WHETHER YOU GET IN OR OUT

2789
02:02:38,584 --> 02:02:41,720
OF A BUSINESS.

2790
02:02:39,451 --> 02:02:43,689
VERY TOUGH TIME TO DECIDE WHAT 

2791
02:02:41,787 --> 02:02:44,490
COMPANIES BENEFIT SOCIETIES MORE

2792
02:02:43,756 --> 02:02:46,325
THAN OTHERS.

2793
02:02:44,557 --> 02:02:49,061
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I THINK 

2794
02:02:46,391 --> 02:02:50,529
CHEVRON'S BENEFITTED SOCIETIES 

2795
02:02:49,128 --> 02:02:53,833
IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS AND I THINK

2796
02:02:50,596 --> 02:02:55,100
IT WILL CONTINUE TO.

2797
02:02:53,899 --> 02:03:01,306
I DO THINK THAT THE WORLD'S 

2798
02:02:55,166 --> 02:03:04,510
MOVING AWAY FROM THEM, TOO.

2799
02:03:01,373 --> 02:03:06,077
THAT COULD CHANGE.

2800
02:03:04,577 --> 02:03:07,412
I DON'T LIKE MAKING THE MORAL 

2801
02:03:06,144 --> 02:03:08,847
JUDGMENTS ON STOCKS IN TERMS OF 

2802
02:03:07,479 --> 02:03:11,416
ACTUALLY RUNNING THE BUSINESSES,

2803
02:03:08,914 --> 02:03:13,118
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT 

2804
02:03:11,483 --> 02:03:18,624
EVERY BUSINESS THAT YOU KNEW 

2805
02:03:13,185 --> 02:03:26,031
WHAT YOU WOULDN'T LIKE AND, YOU 

2806
02:03:18,691 --> 02:03:28,400
KNOW, MEAT PACK ERS, YOU KNOW.

2807
02:03:26,098 --> 02:03:29,835
IF YOU EXPECT PERFECTION IN YOUR

2808
02:03:28,467 --> 02:03:32,304
SPOUSE OR YOUR FRIENDS OR IN 

2809
02:03:29,902 --> 02:03:32,938
COMPANIES, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO 

2810
02:03:32,371 --> 02:03:36,408
FIND IT.

2811
02:03:33,005 --> 02:03:39,144
WHAT YOU ELECT TO DO YOURSELF, 

2812
02:03:36,475 --> 02:03:41,246
IF YOU OWN AN INDEX FUND, YOU 

2813
02:03:39,211 --> 02:03:44,817
OWN -- BELIEVE ME, CHEVRON IS 

2814
02:03:41,313 --> 02:03:48,787
NOT AN EVIL COMPANY IN THE LEAST

2815
02:03:44,884 --> 02:03:49,955
AND I HAVE NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT 

2816
02:03:48,854 --> 02:03:51,290
OWNING -- IN THE LEAST ABOUT 

2817
02:03:50,022 --> 02:03:52,925
OWNING CHEVRON.

2818
02:03:51,357 --> 02:03:55,193
AND IF WE OWNED THE ENTIRE 

2819
02:03:52,992 --> 02:03:56,094
BUSINESS, I WOULD NOT FEEL 

2820
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:57,062
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT BEING IN 

2821
02:03:56,161 --> 02:03:57,295
THAT BUSINESS.

2822
02:03:57,129 --> 02:04:00,933
CHARLIE?

2823
02:03:57,362 --> 02:04:03,735
>> WELL, I AGREE.

2824
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:07,439
YOU CAN IMAGINE TWO THINGS.

2825
02:04:03,802 --> 02:04:08,207
YOUNG MAN MARRIES INTO YOUR 

2826
02:04:07,506 --> 02:04:15,781
FAMILY.

2827
02:04:08,274 --> 02:04:17,916
HE'S AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR AT 

2828
02:04:15,848 --> 02:04:18,617
SWARTHMOREAR HE WORKS FOR 

2829
02:04:17,983 --> 02:04:20,786
CHEVRON?

2830
02:04:18,684 --> 02:04:21,119
WHICH WOULD YOU PICK SIGHT 

2831
02:04:20,853 --> 02:04:22,787
UNSEEN?

2832
02:04:21,186 --> 02:04:24,556
I WILL ADMIT I WOULD TAKE THE 

2833
02:04:22,854 --> 02:04:28,660
GUY FROM CHEVRON.

2834
02:04:24,623 --> 02:04:30,195
>> I HOPE YOUR DAUGHTERS AGREE 

2835
02:04:28,727 --> 02:04:32,431
WITH YOU.

2836
02:04:30,262 --> 02:04:33,065
>> ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT 

2837
02:04:32,498 --> 02:04:35,567
ARGUMENT, BECAUSE THERE WERE 

2838
02:04:33,132 --> 02:04:37,436
LOTS OF EMAILS THAT CAME IN ON 

2839
02:04:35,634 --> 02:04:37,703
BOTH SIDES OF THESE ESG 

2840
02:04:37,503 --> 02:04:40,372
QUESTIONS.

2841
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:42,641
THIS ONE COMES FROM CHRISTINA 

2842
02:04:40,439 --> 02:04:43,875
GALAGOS WHO'S BEEN A 

2843
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:47,479
SHAREHOLDERS SINCE 2018.

2844
02:04:43,942 --> 02:04:48,147
ON ITEMS 2 AND 3 OF THE PROXY 

2845
02:04:47,546 --> 02:04:49,848
MATERIALS THE BOARD RECOMMENDED 

2846
02:04:48,213 --> 02:04:51,616
VOTING AGAINST REGARDING THE 

2847
02:04:49,915 --> 02:04:52,718
REPORTING OF CLIMATE RELATED 

2848
02:04:51,683 --> 02:04:54,953
RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL 

2849
02:04:52,784 --> 02:04:56,755
AS ON THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL 

2850
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:57,890
REGARDING DIVERSITY AND 

2851
02:04:56,822 --> 02:04:59,357
INCLUSION REPORTING.

2852
02:04:57,957 --> 02:05:02,160
BERKSHIRE IS SUCH A FORCE FOR 

2853
02:04:59,424 --> 02:05:03,929
GOOD WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCIAL 

2854
02:05:02,227 --> 02:05:05,564
LITERACY, WHY NOT BE A FORCE FOR

2855
02:05:03,996 --> 02:05:07,232
GOOD AND EXAMPLE WHEN IT COMES 

2856
02:05:05,631 --> 02:05:07,465
TO THESE TWO VERY IMPORTANT 

2857
02:05:07,299 --> 02:05:10,435
ISSUES?

2858
02:05:07,532 --> 02:05:11,436
PLEASE SHARE WITH US MORE ABOUT 

2859
02:05:10,502 --> 02:05:15,774
THE AGAINST RECOMMENDATION.

2860
02:05:11,503 --> 02:05:17,609
>> WELL, I MEAN, GREG CAN TALK A

2861
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:22,714
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT BERKSHIRE 

2862
02:05:17,676 --> 02:05:24,349
HAS DONE AS OPPOSED TO -- IN 

2863
02:05:22,781 --> 02:05:26,485
TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL.

2864
02:05:24,416 --> 02:05:27,986
I WOULD SAY THIS.

2865
02:05:26,552 --> 02:05:29,655
IT'S VERY INTERESTING.

2866
02:05:28,053 --> 02:05:31,723
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING 

2867
02:05:29,722 --> 02:05:34,426
RELEASED, I THINK WE HAVE OVER 1

2868
02:05:31,790 --> 02:05:36,194
MILLION SHAREHOLDERS.

2869
02:05:34,493 --> 02:05:37,663
CAN'T BE SURE BECAUSE OF THE 

2870
02:05:36,261 --> 02:05:37,963
STREET NAME AND DUPLICATE 

2871
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:42,868
ACCOUNTS.

2872
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:44,269
SEEMS VERY, VERY LIKELY.

2873
02:05:42,935 --> 02:05:45,771
I'VE HAD -- AND I GET THE 

2874
02:05:44,336 --> 02:05:49,608
LETTERS THAT ARE WRITTEN TO ME.

2875
02:05:45,838 --> 02:05:51,876
I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD -- I 

2876
02:05:49,675 --> 02:05:57,182
DON'T THINK I'VE HAD THREE 

2877
02:05:51,943 --> 02:05:57,516
LETTERS IN THE LAST YEAR FROM 

2878
02:05:57,249 --> 02:06:01,687
SHAREHOLDERS.

2879
02:05:57,582 --> 02:06:04,222
OUR VOTE ON THIS, AS YOU'LL SEE 

2880
02:06:01,754 --> 02:06:06,024
LATER, IS THAT OVERWHELMINGLY 

2881
02:06:04,289 --> 02:06:07,993
THE PEOPLE THAT BOUGHT BERKSHIRE

2882
02:06:06,091 --> 02:06:08,794
WITH THEIR OWN MONEY VOTED 

2883
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:10,361
AGAINST THOSE.

2884
02:06:08,861 --> 02:06:12,097
MOST OF THE VOTES FOR IT WERE 

2885
02:06:10,428 --> 02:06:13,999
BY -- CAME FROM PEOPLE WHO NEVER

2886
02:06:12,164 --> 02:06:16,702
PUT A DIME OF THEIR OWN MONEY 

2887
02:06:14,066 --> 02:06:18,937
INTO BERKSHIRE.

2888
02:06:16,769 --> 02:06:20,639
AND SO THEY -- AND I DON'T THINK

2889
02:06:19,004 --> 02:06:22,007
THEY READ OUR ANNUAL REPORTS AND

2890
02:06:20,706 --> 02:06:23,875
I DON'T THINK THEY READ THE 

2891
02:06:22,073 --> 02:06:25,610
REPORTS OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY 

2892
02:06:23,942 --> 02:06:27,278
ENERGY AND I DON'T THINK THEY 

2893
02:06:25,677 --> 02:06:29,948
KNOW -- YOU KNOW, I TALK ABOUT 

2894
02:06:27,345 --> 02:06:32,484
WHAT WE'RE DOING IN HIGH VOLTAGE

2895
02:06:30,015 --> 02:06:34,519
TRANSMISSION, WE'RE DOING MORE 

2896
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:34,752
THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY IN THE 

2897
02:06:34,586 --> 02:06:36,121
COUNTRY.

2898
02:06:34,819 --> 02:06:37,756
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT WHAT 

2899
02:06:36,188 --> 02:06:42,728
THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO DO, 

2900
02:06:37,823 --> 02:06:45,464
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS, YOU KNOW?

2901
02:06:42,795 --> 02:06:47,199
WE HAVE A RECORD THAT OVERALL IS

2902
02:06:45,531 --> 02:06:49,067
INCREDIBLY GOOD, BUT WE HAVE A 

2903
02:06:47,265 --> 02:06:50,635
GROUP OF ORGANIZATIONS, JUST 

2904
02:06:49,134 --> 02:06:52,170
GENERALLY, AND THEY'RE NICE 

2905
02:06:50,702 --> 02:06:54,973
PEOPLE BUT THEY WANT US TO 

2906
02:06:52,237 --> 02:06:57,075
ANSWER A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS 

2907
02:06:55,040 --> 02:07:00,712
THEIR WAY SO THEY WANT US TO GO 

2908
02:06:57,142 --> 02:07:03,248
TO DAIRY QUEEN, BORSHIMES, ALL 

2909
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:06,251
OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE FILLING OUT 

2910
02:07:03,315 --> 02:07:06,752
REPORTS AND SHOW A BUNCH OF 

2911
02:07:06,318 --> 02:07:08,887
FIGURES.

2912
02:07:06,819 --> 02:07:11,023
THE REPORTS THAT COUNT ARE THE 

2913
02:07:08,954 --> 02:07:11,290
REPORTS GREG GETS ON BERKSHIRE 

2914
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:13,692
HATHAWAY.

2915
02:07:11,357 --> 02:07:15,761
YOU TALK ABOUT THREE OF OUR 

2916
02:07:13,759 --> 02:07:16,395
COMPANIES, YOU'VE COVERED 95% OF

2917
02:07:15,828 --> 02:07:18,764
IT.

2918
02:07:16,462 --> 02:07:22,067
IT'S ASININE FRANKLY IN MY VIEW.

2919
02:07:18,831 --> 02:07:23,602
WE DO SOME OTHER ASININE THINGS 

2920
02:07:22,134 --> 02:07:24,469
BECAUSE WE'RE REQUIRED TO DO 

2921
02:07:23,669 --> 02:07:28,440
THEM.

2922
02:07:24,536 --> 02:07:28,874
WE'LL DO THEM BECAUSE WE'RE 

2923
02:07:28,507 --> 02:07:31,209
REQUIRED.

2924
02:07:28,941 --> 02:07:33,778
TO HAVE THE PEOPLE AT BUSINESS 

2925
02:07:31,276 --> 02:07:35,680
WIRE, DAIRY QUEEN, ALL THOSE 

2926
02:07:33,845 --> 02:07:36,715
PLACES FILLING OUT REPORTS AND 

2927
02:07:35,747 --> 02:07:38,717
MAKING SOME COMMON REPORT THAT 

2928
02:07:36,782 --> 02:07:39,985
COMES IN, WE DON'T DO THAT STUFF

2929
02:07:38,784 --> 02:07:43,689
AT BERKSHIRE.

2930
02:07:40,052 --> 02:07:44,990
WE'VE GOT -- DURING THE PANDEMIC

2931
02:07:43,756 --> 02:07:46,992
WE PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT 12 PEOPLE

2932
02:07:45,057 --> 02:07:54,199
THAT COME INTO HEADQUARTERS.

2933
02:07:47,059 --> 02:07:56,601
WE'VE GOT 360,000 PEOPLE WORKING

2934
02:07:54,266 --> 02:07:58,603
IN THE COMPANY THAT -- ALL KINDS

2935
02:07:56,668 --> 02:08:00,305
OF DIVERSE ACTIVITIES AND IT'S 

2936
02:07:58,670 --> 02:08:01,807
BUILT -- I DON'T WANT TO GET 

2937
02:08:00,372 --> 02:08:03,675
INTO THE WHOLE THING.

2938
02:08:01,874 --> 02:08:08,980
IT'S BUILT ON AUTONOMY.

2939
02:08:03,741 --> 02:08:10,215
I AM PROBABLY THE ONLY CEO OF AN

2940
02:08:09,047 --> 02:08:13,651
S&P 500 COMPANY THAT DOES NOT 

2941
02:08:10,282 --> 02:08:14,619
GET A CONSOLIDATED INCOME 

2942
02:08:13,718 --> 02:08:17,789
STATEMENT EVERY MONTH.

2943
02:08:14,686 --> 02:08:18,990
I MEAN, EVERY OTHER COMPANY I'LL

2944
02:08:17,856 --> 02:08:20,525
BET IN THE S&P 500 PRINTS OUT 

2945
02:08:19,057 --> 02:08:22,360
THE EARNINGS THEY HAD AT THE 

2946
02:08:20,592 --> 02:08:24,996
END, YOU KNOW, FROM FEBRUARY AND

2947
02:08:22,427 --> 02:08:26,565
MARCH AND CEO GETS THEM AND A 

2948
02:08:25,063 --> 02:08:26,765
WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE GET 

2949
02:08:26,632 --> 02:08:28,233
IT.

2950
02:08:26,832 --> 02:08:29,267
I DON'T GET IT.

2951
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:32,671
I DON'T NEED IT.

2952
02:08:29,334 --> 02:08:33,838
I COULD PUT 60 OR 70 COMPANIES 

2953
02:08:32,738 --> 02:08:35,273
THROUGH A WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE 

2954
02:08:33,905 --> 02:08:36,441
AND EVERYTHING, THEY'D HAND ME 

2955
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:37,175
SOMETHING AND I KNOW THE ANSWER 

2956
02:08:36,508 --> 02:08:38,643
TO IT ALREADY.

2957
02:08:37,242 --> 02:08:40,312
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

2958
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:43,348
THEY'VE GOT THE MONEY THEY NEED.

2959
02:08:40,379 --> 02:08:44,516
SO WE DON'T DO THINGS JUST 

2960
02:08:43,415 --> 02:08:45,950
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A DEPARTMENT 

2961
02:08:44,583 --> 02:08:48,753
OF THIS OR A DEPARTMENT OF THAT 

2962
02:08:46,017 --> 02:08:51,957
AND WE DON'T WANT TO SET UP A 

2963
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:54,626
LOT OF DEPARTMENTS LIKE THAT.

2964
02:08:52,024 --> 02:08:56,427
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS WHAT WE'RE 

2965
02:08:54,693 --> 02:08:58,597
DOING -- WELL, PRIMARILY 

2966
02:08:56,494 --> 02:08:59,264
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY AND THE 

2967
02:08:58,664 --> 02:09:02,000
RAILROAD.

2968
02:08:59,331 --> 02:09:07,172
I'LL LET GREG TELL YOU ABOUT 

2969
02:09:02,067 --> 02:09:10,075
THAT IN JUST ONE SECOND.

2970
02:09:07,239 --> 02:09:11,709
BUT -- p>> I DON'T THINK WE THI 

2971
02:09:10,142 --> 02:09:13,344
KNOW THE ANSWER TO ALL OF THESE 

2972
02:09:11,776 --> 02:09:14,279
QUESTIONS ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING 

2973
02:09:13,411 --> 02:09:16,014
AND SO FORTH.

2974
02:09:14,346 --> 02:09:18,049
PEOPLE WHO ASK THE QUESTIONS 

2975
02:09:16,081 --> 02:09:19,918
THINK THEY KNOW THE ANSWERS, 

2976
02:09:18,116 --> 02:09:22,020
WE'RE JUST MORE MODEST. 

2977
02:09:19,985 --> 02:09:23,788
>> WELL, BUT EVEN IF WE KNEW THE

2978
02:09:22,087 --> 02:09:25,424
ANSWER, IN TERMS OF THE REPORTS 

2979
02:09:23,855 --> 02:09:27,392
WE WOULD -- WE WOULD NOT COLLECT

2980
02:09:25,490 --> 02:09:30,729
A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS THAT DON'T

2981
02:09:27,459 --> 02:09:33,364
MEAN ANYTHING TO US TO SATISFY 

2982
02:09:30,795 --> 02:09:35,100
PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW 

2983
02:09:33,431 --> 02:09:37,535
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

2984
02:09:35,167 --> 02:09:38,804
IN MANY CASES I CAN TELL THEY 

2985
02:09:37,602 --> 02:09:41,773
HAVEN'T READ OUR REPORT.

2986
02:09:38,871 --> 02:09:43,141
WE, AS I POINT OUT IN THE ANNUAL

2987
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:44,309
REPORT, I NEVER -- NOBODY WOULD 

2988
02:09:43,208 --> 02:09:46,945
HAVE GUESSED IT.

2989
02:09:44,376 --> 02:09:48,213
PEOPLE THINK WE'RE A BUNCH OF 

2990
02:09:47,012 --> 02:09:49,681
GUYS THAT OWN STOCKS AND ALL OF 

2991
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:55,086
THAT SORT OF THING.

2992
02:09:49,748 --> 02:09:56,388
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY OWNS BY GAP 

2993
02:09:55,153 --> 02:09:58,122
ACCOUNTING MORE PROPERTY PLANT 

2994
02:09:56,455 --> 02:09:58,656
EQUIPMENT, BUSINESS 

2995
02:09:58,189 --> 02:09:59,725
INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT THE 

2996
02:09:58,723 --> 02:10:02,327
PRESIDENT GOT THROUGH TALKING 

2997
02:09:59,791 --> 02:10:02,694
ABOUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT, 

2998
02:10:02,394 --> 02:10:07,232
INFRASTRUCTURE.

2999
02:10:02,761 --> 02:10:09,168
WE HAVE MEASURED BY GAP 

3000
02:10:07,299 --> 02:10:10,335
ACCOUNTING THAN ANYBODY ELSE, 

3001
02:10:09,234 --> 02:10:12,704
MORE THAN ANY OF THOSE COMPANIES

3002
02:10:10,402 --> 02:10:14,839
ON THE LIST OF LARGEST COMPANIES

3003
02:10:12,771 --> 02:10:15,774
AND WE'VE GOT IT BY A 

3004
02:10:14,906 --> 02:10:18,410
SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN.

3005
02:10:15,841 --> 02:10:22,380
SO WE HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN WHAT

3006
02:10:18,477 --> 02:10:23,982
MAKES THIS COUNTRY MOVE AND 

3007
02:10:22,447 --> 02:10:26,017
WORK.

3008
02:10:24,049 --> 02:10:27,786
15% OF THE INTERSTATE GOODS MOVE

3009
02:10:26,084 --> 02:10:29,554
ON OUR RAILROAD.

3010
02:10:27,853 --> 02:10:36,127
WE'RE BUILDING TRANSMISSION AND 

3011
02:10:29,621 --> 02:10:38,796
WE STARTED IN 2006 OR 7 PLANNING

3012
02:10:36,194 --> 02:10:40,565
HOW WE WOULD CLOSE COAL PLANTS 

3013
02:10:38,863 --> 02:10:42,467
BUT YOU CAN'T CLOSE COAL PLANTS 

3014
02:10:40,631 --> 02:10:45,704
UNTIL YOU GET THE ELECTRICITY 

3015
02:10:42,534 --> 02:10:45,971
FROM WHERE IT'S GENERATED TO THE

3016
02:10:45,771 --> 02:10:51,543
CUSTOMER.

3017
02:10:46,038 --> 02:10:57,082
IF YOU ARE GOING TO GENERATE IT 

3018
02:10:51,609 --> 02:11:00,685
IN WYOMING -- THAT'S THE WAY IT 

3019
02:10:57,148 --> 02:11:01,086
WAS DONE 350 YEARS AGO, 75 YEAR 

3020
02:11:00,752 --> 02:11:02,453
AGO.

3021
02:11:01,153 --> 02:11:04,188
THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE THE 

3022
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:06,024
WIND BLOWING IN WYOMING AND 

3023
02:11:04,255 --> 02:11:06,591
TRYING TO TURN ON THE LIGHTS IN 

3024
02:11:06,091 --> 02:11:08,393
LAS VEGAS.

3025
02:11:06,658 --> 02:11:11,796
WE WENT ON THE PLAN A LOT 

3026
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:12,230
EARLIER THAN PEOPLE WERE TALKING

3027
02:11:11,863 --> 02:11:13,531
ABOUT.

3028
02:11:12,297 --> 02:11:15,267
WE SAID 16 BILLION OR WHATEVER 

3029
02:11:13,598 --> 02:11:15,534
IT WAS IN THE ANNUAL REPORT 

3030
02:11:15,334 --> 02:11:17,468
UNDERWAY.

3031
02:11:15,601 --> 02:11:20,972
WE JUST ADDED 2 BILLION SINCE 

3032
02:11:17,535 --> 02:11:22,840
THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THERE'S NO

3033
02:11:21,039 --> 02:11:24,009
UTILITY IN THE COUNTRY COMING 

3034
02:11:22,907 --> 02:11:25,477
ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT.

3035
02:11:24,076 --> 02:11:26,511
TELL THEM A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT.

3036
02:11:25,544 --> 02:11:27,345
>> SURE.

3037
02:11:26,578 --> 02:11:32,284
THANK YOU.

3038
02:11:27,412 --> 02:11:36,821
AS WARREN TOUCHED ON, BHE AND 

3039
02:11:32,351 --> 02:11:37,923
BHMF HAVE THE SIGNIFICANT CARBON

3040
02:11:36,888 --> 02:11:38,356
FOOTPRINT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT 

3041
02:11:37,990 --> 02:11:39,924
IT.

3042
02:11:38,423 --> 02:11:40,892
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE 

3043
02:11:39,991 --> 02:11:42,026
DISCLOSURE GOING ALL THE WAY 

3044
02:11:40,959 --> 02:11:47,398
BACK TO 2007.

3045
02:11:42,093 --> 02:11:49,567
I DID PULL THOSE TWO INVESTOR 

3046
02:11:47,465 --> 02:11:52,370
PRESENTATIONS FROM 2007 AND THE 

3047
02:11:49,634 --> 02:11:55,273
MOST RECENT ONE FROM 2021.

3048
02:11:52,437 --> 02:11:56,507
IF WE CAN PULL UP BHE 1 AS A 

3049
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:59,010
SLIDE, IT WOULD HIGHLIGHT GOING 

3050
02:11:56,574 --> 02:12:00,345
ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2007 WE'VE 

3051
02:11:59,077 --> 02:12:01,479
BEEN DOING INVESTOR 

3052
02:12:00,411 --> 02:12:05,383
PRESENTATIONS FOR OUR -- WHAT WE

3053
02:12:01,546 --> 02:12:06,584
CALL OUR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS 

3054
02:12:05,450 --> 02:12:08,320
AND WE'VE DONE THAT THROUGH -- 

3055
02:12:06,651 --> 02:12:11,490
EVERY YEAR THROUGH 2021.

3056
02:12:08,387 --> 02:12:13,558
WE'VE PROVIDED VERY SIMILAR 

3057
02:12:11,556 --> 02:12:15,593
DISCLOSURES TO OUR BOARD ON AN 

3058
02:12:13,625 --> 02:12:20,365
ANNUAL BASIS AND HAD DISCUSSIONS

3059
02:12:15,660 --> 02:12:23,435
AROUND BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY'S 

3060
02:12:20,432 --> 02:12:26,104
ENERGY TO DECASH BOW NIEZ.

3061
02:12:23,502 --> 02:12:27,472
IF YOU GO BACK TO THE INCOME 

3062
02:12:26,171 --> 02:12:30,208
CONFERENCE, WE WERE HAVING A 

3063
02:12:27,539 --> 02:12:34,746
CONFERENCE AT THAT TIME, WE HAVE

3064
02:12:30,275 --> 02:12:34,979
THIRD PARTY DEBT, CAPITAL IS 

3065
02:12:34,813 --> 02:12:37,582
RAISED.

3066
02:12:35,046 --> 02:12:41,219
IT'S USED ACROSS THE REGULATED 

3067
02:12:37,649 --> 02:12:42,420
ENTITIES TO MANAGE OUR TOTAL 

3068
02:12:41,286 --> 02:12:43,888
COSTS TO THE UMS CAN.

3069
02:12:42,487 --> 02:12:45,957
WE HAVE INVESTORS.

3070
02:12:43,955 --> 02:12:46,157
WE'RE HIGHLIGHTING ON AN ANNUAL 

3071
02:12:46,024 --> 02:12:48,426
BASIS.

3072
02:12:46,224 --> 02:12:50,395
IF YOU GO BACK TO THAT 2007 

3073
02:12:48,493 --> 02:12:50,729
INVESTOR CONFERENCE, IT'S 

3074
02:12:50,462 --> 02:12:52,430
INTERESTING.

3075
02:12:50,795 --> 02:12:53,331
IN THAT PRESENTATION WE'RE 

3076
02:12:52,497 --> 02:12:56,634
HIGHLIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE, 

3077
02:12:53,398 --> 02:12:58,836
THAT IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL RISK AND

3078
02:12:56,701 --> 02:12:59,170
WE DISCUSS WHAT GOOD POLICY 

3079
02:12:58,903 --> 02:13:03,274
WOULD BE.

3080
02:12:59,237 --> 02:13:04,609
WE DISCUSSED INNOVATION.

3081
02:13:03,341 --> 02:13:05,677
WE DISCUSSED MARKET 

3082
02:13:04,676 --> 02:13:07,612
TRANSFORMATION AND THE 

3083
02:13:05,743 --> 02:13:09,247
IMPORTANCE OF SETTING TARGETS AT

3084
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:10,915
THAT POINT IN TIME.

3085
02:13:09,314 --> 02:13:14,686
AND WE HAD RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 

3086
02:13:10,982 --> 02:13:16,487
OUR INDUSTRY.

3087
02:13:14,753 --> 02:13:19,357
THEN SINCE THEN EACH YEAR WE'VE 

3088
02:13:16,554 --> 02:13:21,692
PRESENTED REALLY A PLAN AND A 

3089
02:13:19,424 --> 02:13:23,861
STRATEGY AROUND HOW EACH OF OUR 

3090
02:13:21,759 --> 02:13:26,097
BUSINESSES IN DHE BUT EACH OF 

3091
02:13:23,928 --> 02:13:27,966
OUR REGULATED ENTITIES, HOW 

3092
02:13:26,164 --> 02:13:30,068
THEY'RE GOING TO TRANSFORM.

3093
02:13:28,033 --> 02:13:32,404
THE WHOLE TRANSFORMATION HAS 

3094
02:13:30,135 --> 02:13:35,206
BEEN AROUND DECARBONIZATION.

3095
02:13:32,471 --> 02:13:38,943
MANAGING THAT RISK ON BEHALF OF 

3096
02:13:35,273 --> 02:13:43,515
OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN MANY STATES,

3097
02:13:39,010 --> 02:13:44,416
CUSTOMERS WE SEARCH, AND FOR 

3098
02:13:43,582 --> 02:13:45,783
BERKSHIRE'S SHAREHOLDERS.

3099
02:13:44,483 --> 02:13:47,085
AS YOU GO THROUGH THOSE 

3100
02:13:45,850 --> 02:13:48,553
PRESENTATIONS THERE'S A COMMON 

3101
02:13:47,151 --> 02:13:48,786
THEME AND WARREN TOUCHED ON IT 

3102
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:52,757
ALREADY.

3103
02:13:48,853 --> 02:13:54,992
YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION

3104
02:13:52,824 --> 02:13:57,195
FIRST AND THAT FOUNDATION IS 

3105
02:13:55,059 --> 02:13:58,329
AROUND BUILDING THE HIGH 

3106
02:13:57,262 --> 02:13:58,763
VOLTAGE, THE TRANSMISSION 

3107
02:13:58,396 --> 02:14:00,531
SYSTEM.

3108
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:01,933
WARREN TOUCHED ON IT IN HIS 

3109
02:14:00,598 --> 02:14:02,166
ANNUAL REPORT THIS YEAR AND 

3110
02:14:01,999 --> 02:14:04,569
LETTER.

3111
02:14:02,233 --> 02:14:06,404
HE HIGHLIGHTED THAT AT BERKSHIRE

3112
02:14:04,636 --> 02:14:10,442
HATHAWAY ENERGY WILL BE SPENDING

3113
02:14:06,471 --> 02:14:10,975
JUST IN THE WEST $18 BILLION ON 

3114
02:14:10,509 --> 02:14:12,744
TRANSMISSION.

3115
02:14:11,042 --> 02:14:17,115
5 BILLION OF THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

3116
02:14:12,811 --> 02:14:19,450
SPENT AS WE SIT HERE TODAY AND 

3117
02:14:17,182 --> 02:14:24,155
THAT 13 BILLION WILL BE SPEND 

3118
02:14:19,517 --> 02:14:30,294
OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

3119
02:14:24,222 --> 02:14:32,463
THAT'S A FOUNDATION THAT WORKS 

3120
02:14:30,361 --> 02:14:34,666
AT BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ENERGY AND

3121
02:14:32,530 --> 02:14:36,601
WELL BEYOND THAT.

3122
02:14:34,733 --> 02:14:38,069
I WOULD HIGHLIGHT WE'VE BEEN 

3123
02:14:36,668 --> 02:14:39,237
BUILDING THE TRANSMISSION 

3124
02:14:38,136 --> 02:14:42,307
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE, WE HAVE

3125
02:14:39,304 --> 02:14:44,742
BEEN BUILDING RENEWABLES.

3126
02:14:42,374 --> 02:14:48,713
IF YOU LOOK AT OUR INVESTMENT 

3127
02:14:44,809 --> 02:14:50,681
THROUGH THE END MUCH 2020 WE'VE 

3128
02:14:48,779 --> 02:14:52,884
INVESTED $30 BILLION OR IN 

3129
02:14:50,748 --> 02:14:54,886
EXCESS OF $30 BILLION INTO 

3130
02:14:52,951 --> 02:14:57,455
RENEWABLES AND HAVE REALLY 

3131
02:14:54,953 --> 02:14:59,490
COMPLETELY CHANGED THE WAY OUR 

3132
02:14:57,522 --> 02:15:01,059
BUSINESSES DO BUSINESS, I.E.,, 

3133
02:14:59,557 --> 02:15:03,227
OUR UTILITY BASES.

3134
02:15:01,126 --> 02:15:05,397
THEY'VE BEEN DECARBONIZING AND 

3135
02:15:03,294 --> 02:15:08,699
DELIVERING A VALUE PRODUCT TO 

3136
02:15:05,463 --> 02:15:09,267
OUR STAKEHOLDERS, TO OUR 

3137
02:15:08,766 --> 02:15:11,202
CUSTOMERS.

3138
02:15:09,334 --> 02:15:14,205
AND I THINK THE -- AND I THINK 

3139
02:15:11,269 --> 02:15:15,340
THE RESULTS ARE REALLY AMAZING 

3140
02:15:14,272 --> 02:15:16,741
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM.

3141
02:15:15,407 --> 02:15:17,375
I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF 

3142
02:15:16,808 --> 02:15:20,044
REFERENCE POINTS.

3143
02:15:17,442 --> 02:15:26,884
IF YOU GO BACK TO 2015 WHEN THE 

3144
02:15:20,111 --> 02:15:29,153
U.S. WAS DISCUSSING, EXCUSE ME, 

3145
02:15:26,951 --> 02:15:30,588
JOINING THE PARIS AGREEMENT, 

3146
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:30,855
VERY SPECIFIC TARGETS WERE BEING

3147
02:15:30,655 --> 02:15:32,623
SET.

3148
02:15:30,922 --> 02:15:35,192
PRIOR TO THE TARGETS BEING SET 

3149
02:15:32,690 --> 02:15:36,695
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY AND 12 OTHER 

3150
02:15:35,259 --> 02:15:41,199
COMPANIES INCLUDING THE APPLES 

3151
02:15:36,761 --> 02:15:44,202
OF THE WORLD, GOOGLE, WALMART 

3152
02:15:41,266 --> 02:15:45,503
COMMITTED TO TARIFFS AND TARGETS

3153
02:15:44,269 --> 02:15:50,976
NEEDED TO BE SET.

3154
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:51,209
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY WAS ONE OF 

3155
02:15:51,042 --> 02:15:56,281
THOSE. 

3156
02:15:51,276 --> 02:15:56,915
>> HOW MANY OTHER COMMIT WRMTS 

3157
02:15:56,348 --> 02:15:57,782
THERE.

3158
02:15:56,982 --> 02:15:59,750
>> THERE WERE NONE.

3159
02:15:57,849 --> 02:16:00,652
I'M HAPPY TO REPORT WE MADE A 

3160
02:15:59,817 --> 02:16:02,387
VARIETY OF PLEDGES.

3161
02:16:00,719 --> 02:16:04,889
ONE OF THEM WAS AT THAT POINT WE

3162
02:16:02,454 --> 02:16:06,457
HAD INVESTED $15 BILLION IN 

3163
02:16:04,956 --> 02:16:08,159
RENEWABLES AND WE WOULD COMMIT 

3164
02:16:06,524 --> 02:16:11,763
30 BILLION IN TOTAL.

3165
02:16:08,226 --> 02:16:12,997
WELL, WE'VE FAR EXCEEDED THAT 

3166
02:16:11,829 --> 02:16:15,099
TOTAL NOW.

3167
02:16:13,064 --> 02:16:25,443
THERE'S BEEN A CLEAR COMMITMENT 

3168
02:16:15,166 --> 02:16:26,077
TO REDUCE DECASH BOW NEEDING THE

3169
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:26,644
BUSINESS.

3170
02:16:26,144 --> 02:16:27,045
THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE AND 

3171
02:16:26,711 --> 02:16:28,946
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

3172
02:16:27,111 --> 02:16:30,682
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STANDARDS 

3173
02:16:29,013 --> 02:16:32,350
THAT ARE SET WITH THE ORIGINAL 

3174
02:16:30,749 --> 02:16:33,718
U.S. GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENTS 

3175
02:16:32,417 --> 02:16:36,621
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PARIS 

3176
02:16:33,785 --> 02:16:43,895
AGREEMENT, THE TARGET WAS 26 TO 

3177
02:16:36,688 --> 02:16:50,234
28% REDUCTIONS IN CARBON FOOT 

3178
02:16:43,962 --> 02:16:53,371
PRINDS GOING BACK TO OO O 5 -- 

3179
02:16:50,301 --> 02:16:56,507
>> NO, WE COMMITTED TO THAT AT 

3180
02:16:53,438 --> 02:16:57,942
BHE AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT AND 

3181
02:16:56,574 --> 02:16:59,177
WE BRIEFED OUR BOARD, WE 

3182
02:16:58,009 --> 02:17:01,946
ACHIEVED THAT IN 2020.

3183
02:16:59,244 --> 02:17:04,815
SO WE MET OUR PLEDGE AND WE MET 

3184
02:17:02,013 --> 02:17:06,685
THE COMMITMENT UNDER THE PARIS 

3185
02:17:04,882 --> 02:17:08,219
AGREEMENT AND THEN IF YOU FAST 

3186
02:17:06,751 --> 02:17:11,022
FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSIONS THAT 

3187
02:17:08,286 --> 02:17:13,758
ARE OCCURRING RIGHT NOW OR HAVE 

3188
02:17:11,089 --> 02:17:16,060
OCCURRED AROUND REJOINING THE 

3189
02:17:13,825 --> 02:17:18,062
PARIS AGREEMENT, THE CURRENT 

3190
02:17:16,127 --> 02:17:21,098
ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED 

3191
02:17:18,129 --> 02:17:23,635
THAT, AGAIN, USING 2005 AS THE 

3192
02:17:21,165 --> 02:17:28,739
STARTING POINT, THAT THE 

3193
02:17:23,702 --> 02:17:32,277
EMISSION GOALS OR REDUCTIONS 

3194
02:17:28,806 --> 02:17:34,478
SHOULD BE 2/3.

3195
02:17:32,344 --> 02:17:35,747
I'M HAPPY TO BRIEF TO OUR 

3196
02:17:34,545 --> 02:17:37,848
SHAREHOLDERS AND BRIEFINGS WE'VE

3197
02:17:35,814 --> 02:17:40,751
PROVIDED TO OUR BOARD, BUT 

3198
02:17:37,915 --> 02:17:43,988
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ENERGY WILL 

3199
02:17:40,818 --> 02:17:46,891
ACHIEVE THAT BY 2030.

3200
02:17:44,055 --> 02:17:54,365
AGAIN, THE REASON WE CAN DO IT 

3201
02:17:46,958 --> 02:17:55,533
IS WE'VE BUILD THE FOUNDATION.

3202
02:17:54,432 --> 02:17:57,101
WARREN'S HIGHLIGHTED IT AND 

3203
02:17:55,600 --> 02:17:58,870
FOLLOWED IT UP WITH SPECIFIC 

3204
02:17:57,168 --> 02:17:59,103
INVESTMENTS ON THE RENEWABLE 

3205
02:17:58,937 --> 02:18:02,507
SIDE.

3206
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:04,008
I HAVE ONE INCREMENTAL SLIDE 

3207
02:18:02,573 --> 02:18:07,512
THAT I DON'T -- THINK SORT OF 

3208
02:18:04,075 --> 02:18:14,619
HOLDS IT ALTOGETHER AND THAT'S 

3209
02:18:07,579 --> 02:18:15,853
VHAE 2 BECAUSE AS PEOPLE DISCUSS

3210
02:18:14,686 --> 02:18:17,522
COAL UNITS.

3211
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:18,723
HOW MANY HAVE YOU OWNED, HOW 

3212
02:18:17,588 --> 02:18:20,491
MANY HAVE YOU CLOSED?

3213
02:18:18,789 --> 02:18:22,794
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT CAN 

3214
02:18:20,558 --> 02:18:25,630
BE AN IMPORTANT METRIC BUT IT IS

3215
02:18:22,861 --> 02:18:27,098
A TRANSITION AND WE HAVE VERY 

3216
02:18:25,697 --> 02:18:30,167
MUCH FOCUSED ACROSS THE THREE 

3217
02:18:27,165 --> 02:18:31,369
UTILITIES WE OWN AND THE ONES 

3218
02:18:30,234 --> 02:18:33,504
WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED ON THE SLIDE 

3219
02:18:31,436 --> 02:18:35,639
IS TO TRANSITION FROM OUR 

3220
02:18:33,571 --> 02:18:39,744
EXISTING FLEET TO RENEWABLES 

3221
02:18:35,706 --> 02:18:43,080
USING TRANSMISSION.

3222
02:18:39,811 --> 02:18:44,649
WE HAVE NOT BECOME OVERLY 

3223
02:18:43,147 --> 02:18:44,882
RESISTANT ON TRANSITIONING TO 

3224
02:18:44,716 --> 02:18:49,854
GAS.

3225
02:18:44,949 --> 02:18:51,022
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME OUR COAL 

3226
02:18:49,921 --> 02:18:52,790
REQUIREMENTS WILL DECLINE.

3227
02:18:51,089 --> 02:18:54,926
I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THROUGH 

3228
02:18:52,857 --> 02:18:55,193
2020 WE'VE CLOSED 16 UNITS TO 

3229
02:18:54,993 --> 02:18:59,130
DATE.

3230
02:18:55,260 --> 02:19:01,465
IF YOU LOOK AT FROM 2021 THROUGH

3231
02:18:59,197 --> 02:19:03,467
2030 THERE WILL BE AN 

3232
02:19:01,532 --> 02:19:05,636
INCREMENTAL 16 UNITS CLOSED AND 

3233
02:19:03,534 --> 02:19:09,440
THEN IF YOU GO THROUGH TO THE 

3234
02:19:05,703 --> 02:19:12,343
END OF 2049 OUR REMAINING 14 

3235
02:19:09,507 --> 02:19:19,517
UNITS WILL BE CLOSED AND AT THAT

3236
02:19:12,410 --> 02:19:19,884
POINT IN TIME ALL OUR UNITS 

3237
02:19:19,584 --> 02:19:22,253
CLOSE.

3238
02:19:19,951 --> 02:19:23,454
THAT'S AN AGGREGATION OF ALL OF 

3239
02:19:22,319 --> 02:19:25,556
THE ACTIVITIES OUR BUSINESS 

3240
02:19:23,521 --> 02:19:27,024
UNITS HAVE BEEN TAKING TO HELP 

3241
02:19:25,623 --> 02:19:31,128
FACILITATE THAT TRANSITION AND 

3242
02:19:27,091 --> 02:19:33,164
REALLY TRANSITIONING TO A -- 

3243
02:19:31,195 --> 02:19:35,099
DECASH BOW NIEZING THOSE UNITS 

3244
02:19:33,231 --> 02:19:37,068
AND DECASH BOW NIEZING OUR 

3245
02:19:35,166 --> 02:19:38,903
BUSINESSES ON BEHALF OF FIRST 

3246
02:19:37,134 --> 02:19:40,505
AND FOREMOST OUR CUSTOMERS, THE 

3247
02:19:38,970 --> 02:19:44,342
MANY STAKEHOLDERS THEY REPRESENT

3248
02:19:40,572 --> 02:19:45,676
IN THE VARIOUS STATES AND THEN 

3249
02:19:44,409 --> 02:19:47,144
EQUALLY IMPORTANT DECAR BOW 

3250
02:19:45,743 --> 02:19:49,847
NIEZING THOSE BUSINESSES ON 

3251
02:19:47,211 --> 02:19:50,815
BEHALF OF OUR BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY

3252
02:19:49,914 --> 02:19:52,583
SHAREHOLDERS.

3253
02:19:50,882 --> 02:19:54,919
THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD 

3254
02:19:52,650 --> 02:20:00,057
ADD, BECAUSE IT IS THE ENTITY 

3255
02:19:54,986 --> 02:20:05,463
THAT HAS A SECOND LARGEST 

3256
02:20:00,124 --> 02:20:06,330
FOOTPRINT IN BERKSHIRE AND WHEN 

3257
02:20:05,530 --> 02:20:08,032
YOU COMBINE THEM, YOU'RE TALKING

3258
02:20:06,397 --> 02:20:11,335
THE MATERIAL SET OF EMISSIONS 

3259
02:20:08,099 --> 02:20:13,204
WITHIN BERKSHIRE, BNSF HAS ALSO 

3260
02:20:11,402 --> 02:20:17,909
BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN MANAGING 

3261
02:20:13,271 --> 02:20:20,111
THEIR CARBON PROFILE.

3262
02:20:17,976 --> 02:20:20,778
THEY'VE COMMITTED TO HAVE 

3263
02:20:20,178 --> 02:20:22,780
SCIENCE-BASED TARGETS 

3264
02:20:20,845 --> 02:20:24,548
ESTABLISHED FOR 2030 SO, AGAIN, 

3265
02:20:22,847 --> 02:20:28,619
THOSE TARGETS WILL AGAIN BE 

3266
02:20:24,615 --> 02:20:29,053
CONSISTENT WITH THE PARIS 

3267
02:20:28,686 --> 02:20:30,387
AGREEMENT.

3268
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:33,291
WE'VE SEEN WHAT THE OTHER 

3269
02:20:30,454 --> 02:20:35,059
PARTICIPANTS OR SOME OF THEM IN 

3270
02:20:33,357 --> 02:20:37,695
THE CLASS -- IN THE INDUSTRY 

3271
02:20:35,126 --> 02:20:39,730
THAT HAVE COMMITTED TO AND OUR 

3272
02:20:37,762 --> 02:20:47,538
COMMITMENT WILL BE VERY SIMILAR,

3273
02:20:39,797 --> 02:20:52,243
I.E.,, IT WILL BE CONSISTENT.

3274
02:20:47,605 --> 02:20:54,579
SO, AGAIN, IF YOU LOOK AT OUR --

3275
02:20:52,310 --> 02:20:54,946
AND THAT'S BEEN PUBLICLY 

3276
02:20:54,646 --> 02:20:58,683
DISCLOSED.

3277
02:20:55,013 --> 02:21:00,284
THAT'S ON THE BSNF WEBSITE.

3278
02:20:58,750 --> 02:21:03,487
EVERYTHING I'VE DISCUSSED IS ON 

3279
02:21:00,351 --> 02:21:05,422
THEIR WEBSITE, FILED IN 8Ks, 

3280
02:21:03,554 --> 02:21:06,524
COMPLETELY ACCESSIBLE BY OUR 

3281
02:21:05,489 --> 02:21:08,359
MANY SHAREHOLDERS.

3282
02:21:06,591 --> 02:21:10,761
WHEN I LOOK AT IT FROM THE 

3283
02:21:08,426 --> 02:21:12,130
PERSPECTIVE OF OUR BERKSHIRE 

3284
02:21:10,828 --> 02:21:15,033
SHAREHOLDERS, I REALLY BELIEVE 

3285
02:21:12,196 --> 02:21:16,801
THIS RISK IS BEING WELL MANAGED 

3286
02:21:15,099 --> 02:21:21,272
AND IN POSITIONING OURSELVES FOR

3287
02:21:16,867 --> 02:21:23,073
THE LONG TERM.

3288
02:21:21,339 --> 02:21:25,009
>> INCIDENTALLY, THE PRESIDENT 

3289
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:27,178
THE OTHER NIGHT TALKED ABOUT 100

3290
02:21:25,076 --> 02:21:29,847
BILLION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE.

3291
02:21:27,245 --> 02:21:30,348
WE'D LOVE TO SPEND 100 BILLION 

3292
02:21:29,914 --> 02:21:34,952
ON IT.

3293
02:21:30,415 --> 02:21:38,089
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, 

3294
02:21:35,019 --> 02:21:38,322
TRANSMISSION IS REALLY THE 

3295
02:21:38,156 --> 02:21:40,758
PROBLEM.

3296
02:21:38,389 --> 02:21:42,126
A BIG PROBLEM.

3297
02:21:40,825 --> 02:21:46,263
YOU'VE GOT TO GET MORE OF THE 

3298
02:21:42,193 --> 02:21:48,465
SUN IS SHINING AND WHERE THE 

3299
02:21:46,330 --> 02:21:52,236
WIND IS BLOWING ESSENTIALLY TO 

3300
02:21:48,532 --> 02:21:56,340
CONCENTRATIONS OF POPULATION.

3301
02:21:52,303 --> 02:21:59,410
AND IT'LL BE -- YOU CROSS STATE 

3302
02:21:56,407 --> 02:22:00,111
LINES AND YOU GO THROUGH 

3303
02:21:59,477 --> 02:22:01,812
PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS.

3304
02:22:00,178 --> 02:22:03,181
IT'S -- IT'S -- WHETHER THE 

3305
02:22:01,879 --> 02:22:04,448
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A BETTER 

3306
02:22:03,247 --> 02:22:06,317
LUCK IN JUST SAYING THIS IS THE 

3307
02:22:04,515 --> 02:22:08,118
WAY IT'S GOING TO BE DONE, 

3308
02:22:06,383 --> 02:22:09,754
RAMMING IT DOWN THE THROATS OF 

3309
02:22:08,185 --> 02:22:11,856
WHERE THEY GO AND GETTING IT 

3310
02:22:09,821 --> 02:22:18,262
DONE, I MEAN, THEY MAY HAVE THAT

3311
02:22:11,923 --> 02:22:22,199
POWER AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO 

3312
02:22:18,329 --> 02:22:24,969
IT FASTER THAN WE CAN.

3313
02:22:22,266 --> 02:22:27,137
THE SPEED, WE BOUGHT CARBON IN 

3314
02:22:25,036 --> 02:22:30,341
2006, WE HAD A BUNCH OF 

3315
02:22:27,204 --> 02:22:31,976
CUSTOMERS IN THE WEST AND THEY 

3316
02:22:30,408 --> 02:22:33,577
HAD PEOPLE SERVING THEM.

3317
02:22:32,043 --> 02:22:35,813
TO CHANGE THAT YOU HAVE TO GO 

3318
02:22:33,644 --> 02:22:40,885
WHERE WIND BLOWS AND DELIVER IT.

3319
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:43,020
SO IT'S -- BUT IT IS INTERESTING

3320
02:22:40,952 --> 02:22:43,320
THAT WE HAVE PUBLISHED THIS 

3321
02:22:43,087 --> 02:22:45,289
INFORMATION.

3322
02:22:43,387 --> 02:22:47,658
WE SPENT FAR MORE THAN ANY 

3323
02:22:45,356 --> 02:22:49,026
UTILITY IN TERMS OF RENEWABLES 

3324
02:22:47,725 --> 02:22:49,293
AND TRANSMISSION IN THE UNITED 

3325
02:22:49,093 --> 02:22:55,232
STATES.

3326
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:56,901
WE SHARED IT WITH ENOUGH BUT 

3327
02:22:55,299 --> 02:22:58,869
OUR -- THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THE

3328
02:22:56,968 --> 02:22:59,704
STOCK WITH THEIR OWN MONEY, THE 

3329
02:22:58,936 --> 02:23:01,906
INDIVIDUALS, THEY SEEM TO 

3330
02:22:59,771 --> 02:23:02,473
UNDERSTAND IT AND THEY READ THE 

3331
02:23:01,973 --> 02:23:04,041
REPORTS.

3332
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:05,576
WE GET CALLS AND THEY SAY, WELL,

3333
02:23:04,108 --> 02:23:06,444
WE WANT TO COME OUT AND TALK TO 

3334
02:23:05,642 --> 02:23:08,812
YOU ABOUT IT.

3335
02:23:06,511 --> 02:23:09,647
WE'RE NOT TALKING TO THEM AND 

3336
02:23:08,879 --> 02:23:11,249
IGNORING THE MILLION PEOPLE THAT

3337
02:23:09,714 --> 02:23:13,050
HAVE BEEN WITH US OVER TIME AND 

3338
02:23:11,315 --> 02:23:17,121
BOUGHT IT WITH THEIR OWN MONEY.

3339
02:23:13,117 --> 02:23:21,459
WE WILL NOT GIVE SPECIAL 

3340
02:23:17,188 --> 02:23:27,598
TREATMENT TO EITHER THE ANALYSTS

3341
02:23:21,525 --> 02:23:29,500
OR TO THE INSTITUTIONS, WHO 

3342
02:23:27,665 --> 02:23:31,936
TRUST US WITH THEIR SAVINGS. 

3343
02:23:29,566 --> 02:23:32,803
>> THIS QUESTION IS FOR WARREN 

3344
02:23:32,003 --> 02:23:35,206
ENERGY.

3345
02:23:32,870 --> 02:23:37,775
IT COMES FROM FERNANDO LEWIS.

3346
02:23:35,273 --> 02:23:40,377
AS A SHAREHOLDER THAT INTENDS TO

3347
02:23:37,842 --> 02:23:41,312
REMAIN SO FOR MANY DECADES, MY 

3348
02:23:40,444 --> 02:23:42,746
BIGGEST CONCERN IS AROUND 

3349
02:23:41,378 --> 02:23:44,649
POSSIBLE LOSSES ARISING FROM 

3350
02:23:42,813 --> 02:23:45,182
HIGHER THAN EXPECTED INSURANCE 

3351
02:23:44,716 --> 02:23:46,950
LOSSES.

3352
02:23:45,249 --> 02:23:50,554
WE'VE SEEN THIS IN OTHER 

3353
02:23:47,017 --> 02:23:51,188
COMPANIES WHERE UNDERWRITING 

3354
02:23:50,621 --> 02:23:51,522
MISTAKES CRIPPLE BUSINESSES THAT

3355
02:23:51,255 --> 02:23:54,758
ARE EXEMPLAR.

3356
02:23:51,589 --> 02:23:56,627
I UNDERSTAND BERKSHIRE'S CULTURE

3357
02:23:54,825 --> 02:23:57,595
IS UNIQUE, THIS IS A RISK THAT 

3358
02:23:56,694 --> 02:24:00,631
CONCERNS ME.

3359
02:23:57,662 --> 02:24:03,600
MANY OF US SHAREHOLDERS FEEL 

3360
02:24:00,698 --> 02:24:04,268
COMFORTABLE NOW GIVEN THE 

3361
02:24:03,667 --> 02:24:05,302
PRIVILEGE OF HAVING YOU LOOK AT 

3362
02:24:04,334 --> 02:24:07,304
THESE DEALS, HOWEVER, THERE WILL

3363
02:24:05,369 --> 02:24:08,205
BE A DAY WHEN THIS IS NO LONGER 

3364
02:24:07,371 --> 02:24:11,108
THE CASE.

3365
02:24:08,272 --> 02:24:12,342
IS IT REASONABLE TO THINK OVER 

3366
02:24:11,175 --> 02:24:17,181
THE LONG TERM THEY SHOULD LOOK 

3367
02:24:12,409 --> 02:24:20,551
AT GEICO AND REDUCE THE 

3368
02:24:17,248 --> 02:24:22,520
LONG-TAIL RISK?

3369
02:24:20,618 --> 02:24:24,488
I HAVE THE BEST GRATITUDE.

3370
02:24:22,587 --> 02:24:27,258
I'M CONFIDENT WE HAVE THE TALENT

3371
02:24:24,555 --> 02:24:27,458
TO REMAIN LEADERS FOR DECADES TO

3372
02:24:27,325 --> 02:24:30,527
COME.

3373
02:24:27,525 --> 02:24:31,395
THIS IS BEARSED ON THE INHERENT 

3374
02:24:30,594 --> 02:24:33,597
OPAQUENESS AND RISK. 

3375
02:24:31,462 --> 02:24:33,964
>> AJIT, DO YOU WANT TO LEAD 

3376
02:24:33,664 --> 02:24:36,500
OFF?

3377
02:24:34,031 --> 02:24:39,337
>> I MEAN, CLEARLY CONTRACT 

3378
02:24:36,567 --> 02:24:41,138
CERTAINTY IS AN ISSUE FOR US IN 

3379
02:24:39,403 --> 02:24:44,908
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

3380
02:24:41,205 --> 02:24:47,277
IT IS AN ISSUE THAT CUTS ACROSS 

3381
02:24:44,975 --> 02:24:49,647
THE LONG TAIL LINE BUT EVEN 

3382
02:24:47,344 --> 02:24:53,117
SHORT TAIL PROPERTY FOCUS LINES.

3383
02:24:49,714 --> 02:24:54,351
MOST RECENT EXAMPLE IS BUSINESS 

3384
02:24:53,183 --> 02:24:56,887
INTERRUPTION WHICH IS AN 

3385
02:24:54,418 --> 02:25:01,225
INTEGRAL PART OF ANY INSURANCE 

3386
02:24:56,954 --> 02:25:01,525
POLICY BOUGHT AND SOLD BY 

3387
02:25:01,292 --> 02:25:05,796
CRPORATIONS.

3388
02:25:01,592 --> 02:25:07,631
IT IS A RISK EVERY TIME WE ISSUE

3389
02:25:05,863 --> 02:25:09,500
A CONTRACT THAT EITHER BECAUSE 

3390
02:25:07,698 --> 02:25:11,769
OF SLOPPINESS IN HOW THAT 

3391
02:25:09,567 --> 02:25:12,703
CONTRACT IS WRITTEN OR BECAUSE 

3392
02:25:11,836 --> 02:25:16,440
OF THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WE

3393
02:25:12,770 --> 02:25:17,875
ALL HAVE TO LIVE IN THAT THE 

3394
02:25:16,506 --> 02:25:18,142
WORDS IN THE CONTRACT MAY BE 

3395
02:25:17,942 --> 02:25:19,877
TORTURED.

3396
02:25:18,209 --> 02:25:21,545
NORMALLY WHEN THEY ARE TORTURED,

3397
02:25:19,944 --> 02:25:24,415
THEY END UP GOING AGAINST THE 

3398
02:25:21,612 --> 02:25:24,715
INSURANCE INDUSTRY, NOT IN THEIR

3399
02:25:24,482 --> 02:25:26,617
FAVOR.

3400
02:25:24,782 --> 02:25:28,552
SO IT IS A RISK.

3401
02:25:26,684 --> 02:25:30,755
IT'S AN UNKNOWN RISK IN TERMS OF

3402
02:25:28,619 --> 02:25:32,857
HOW BAD IT CAN BE.

3403
02:25:30,822 --> 02:25:34,792
I HOPE WE PRICE FOR IT WHEN WE 

3404
02:25:32,923 --> 02:25:36,293
PRICE FOR THE PRODUCT, THROW IN 

3405
02:25:34,859 --> 02:25:37,394
SOMETHING FOR THE UNKNOWN 

3406
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:42,600
UNKNOWNS, IF YOU WILL.

3407
02:25:37,461 --> 02:25:44,935
WE TRY AND AGGREGATE EXPOSURES 

3408
02:25:42,666 --> 02:25:46,504
BY RISK CATEGORIES.

3409
02:25:45,002 --> 02:25:49,173
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL GIVE US SOME

3410
02:25:46,571 --> 02:25:50,507
COMFORT IN TERMS OF SOME 

3411
02:25:49,239 --> 02:25:51,275
BOUNDARIES ON WHAT THE EXPOSURE 

3412
02:25:50,574 --> 02:25:53,443
REALLY CAN BE.

3413
02:25:51,342 --> 02:25:54,278
THERE'S NO QUESTION THE 

3414
02:25:53,510 --> 02:25:56,146
REGULATORS PLAY AN IMPORTANT 

3415
02:25:54,345 --> 02:25:57,515
ROLE IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMICS 

3416
02:25:56,213 --> 02:26:00,518
OF THE BUSINESS, ESPECIALLY IN 

3417
02:25:57,581 --> 02:26:01,752
THE U.S. WHERE THE 50 STATE 

3418
02:26:00,585 --> 02:26:04,822
REGULATORS WHO WE HAVE TO DEAL 

3419
02:26:01,819 --> 02:26:05,723
WITH IN TERMS OF PRICING, IN 

3420
02:26:04,889 --> 02:26:09,026
TERMS OF CONTRACTS. 

3421
02:26:05,790 --> 02:26:12,096
>> MOST OF THOSE SURPRISES IN 

3422
02:26:09,093 --> 02:26:12,730
INSURANCE, MOST OF THEM ARE 

3423
02:26:12,163 --> 02:26:13,030
UNPL

3424
02:26:12,797 --> 02:26:16,800
UNPLEASANT.

3425
02:26:13,097 --> 02:26:17,535
YOU GET THE PREMIUM UNFRONT, 

3426
02:26:16,867 --> 02:26:20,604
THAT'S PLEASANT.

3427
02:26:17,602 --> 02:26:20,837
YOU GET SOME VERY IMAGINATIVE 

3428
02:26:20,671 --> 02:26:26,611
LOSSES.

3429
02:26:20,904 --> 02:26:27,912
WE ARE WILLING TO LOSE IN TERMS 

3430
02:26:26,677 --> 02:26:29,313
OF THE OUTSIDE LIMIT.

3431
02:26:27,979 --> 02:26:32,616
WE'RE WILLING TO LOSE $10 

3432
02:26:29,380 --> 02:26:34,484
BILLION IN A SINGLE EVENT.

3433
02:26:32,683 --> 02:26:35,719
WE WANT TO GET PAID VERY 

3434
02:26:34,551 --> 02:26:40,191
APPROPRIATELY FOR THAT, BUT 

3435
02:26:35,786 --> 02:26:40,991
WE'VE GOT THE RESOURCE TOSS DO 

3436
02:26:40,258 --> 02:26:45,462
IT.

3437
02:26:41,058 --> 02:26:46,062
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE 10 

3438
02:26:45,529 --> 02:26:47,198
BECO

3439
02:26:46,129 --> 02:26:48,499
BILLION IN SOMETHING WHERE WE 

3440
02:26:47,265 --> 02:26:52,736
THOUGHT WE WOULD LOSE 50 MILLION

3441
02:26:48,566 --> 02:26:54,071
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

3442
02:26:52,803 --> 02:26:55,673
THE CURRENT SITUATION, FOR 

3443
02:26:54,138 --> 02:26:57,341
EXAMPLE, WITH THE BOY SCOUTS OF 

3444
02:26:55,740 --> 02:26:58,508
AMERICA, I THINK THERE WERE 1100

3445
02:26:57,408 --> 02:27:00,277
CLAIMS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 

3446
02:26:58,575 --> 02:27:00,911
THAT HAD BEEN FILED AND NOW 

3447
02:27:00,344 --> 02:27:04,315
THERE'S 17,000 -- 

3448
02:27:00,978 --> 02:27:07,017
>> NO, NO, CLOSE TO 100,000.

3449
02:27:04,382 --> 02:27:10,254
UP BY 50 TIMES.

3450
02:27:07,084 --> 02:27:10,454
>> THESE GO BACK TO 1950 AND 

3451
02:27:10,321 --> 02:27:12,656
1960.

3452
02:27:10,521 --> 02:27:13,591
YOU HAVE PEOPLE ADVERTISING FOR 

3453
02:27:12,723 --> 02:27:19,797
CLAIMS.

3454
02:27:13,658 --> 02:27:20,531
I'M SURE A LOT OF THEM ARE VALID

3455
02:27:19,864 --> 02:27:22,666
OR INVALID?

3456
02:27:20,598 --> 02:27:23,567
>> IT GOES BACK TO THE ISSUE 

3457
02:27:22,733 --> 02:27:25,202
THAT YOU JUST RAISED.

3458
02:27:23,634 --> 02:27:28,539
THE REASON WHY THE NUMBER OF 

3459
02:27:25,269 --> 02:27:30,674
CLAIMS HAS SKYROCKETED FROM LESS

3460
02:27:28,606 --> 02:27:33,143
THAN 200,000 IS BECAUSE THE 

3461
02:27:30,741 --> 02:27:34,578
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS HAD 

3462
02:27:33,210 --> 02:27:36,680
EXPIRED, BUT IN SEVERAL STATES 

3463
02:27:34,645 --> 02:27:38,448
IF NOT IN MORE STATES THEY HAVE 

3464
02:27:36,747 --> 02:27:39,884
UNILATERALLY EXTENDED THE 

3465
02:27:38,515 --> 02:27:41,652
DEADLINE BY WHEN YOU CAN MAKE 

3466
02:27:39,951 --> 02:27:43,621
CLAIMS AND EXPANDED IT BY A FEW 

3467
02:27:41,719 --> 02:27:49,093
YEARS AS A RESULT OF WHICH A LOT

3468
02:27:43,687 --> 02:27:49,994
OF MORE CLAIMS APPEARED.

3469
02:27:49,160 --> 02:27:51,862
FUNDED BY PLAINTIFF LAWYERS THAT

3470
02:27:50,061 --> 02:27:52,529
ARE VERY WELL FUNDED.

3471
02:27:51,929 --> 02:27:56,367
THAT RESULTS IN CLAIMS JUST 

3472
02:27:52,596 --> 02:27:57,134
SKYROCKETING.

3473
02:27:56,434 --> 02:28:00,838
>> YEAH.

3474
02:27:57,201 --> 02:28:02,773
A LOT OF UNPLEASANT SURPRISES IN

3475
02:28:00,905 --> 02:28:04,775
INSURANCE.

3476
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:05,542
WE'VE GOT A VERY -- I'M VERY 

3477
02:28:04,842 --> 02:28:07,511
BIASED ON THIS.

3478
02:28:05,609 --> 02:28:10,014
I THINK WE'VE GOT THE BEST 

3479
02:28:07,578 --> 02:28:11,949
INSURANCE OPERATION IN THE WORLD

3480
02:28:10,081 --> 02:28:12,116
AND AJIT IS THE GUY THAT CREATED

3481
02:28:12,016 --> 02:28:16,187
IT.

3482
02:28:12,182 --> 02:28:19,823
THE PEOPLE AT GEICO, WE BOUGHT 

3483
02:28:16,253 --> 02:28:21,558
THAT AND DID WONDERFULLY OVER 

3484
02:28:19,890 --> 02:28:23,227
TIME TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT.

3485
02:28:21,625 --> 02:28:27,197
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE.

3486
02:28:23,294 --> 02:28:30,667
AJIT IS A SYMPHONY CONDUCTOR.

3487
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:31,535
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM 

3488
02:28:30,734 --> 02:28:33,504
HENRY ZOO.

3489
02:28:31,602 --> 02:28:34,939
IT LOOKS LIKE CHARLIE AND WARREN

3490
02:28:33,571 --> 02:28:36,407
HAVE SOME DIFFERENT OPINIONS 

3491
02:28:35,006 --> 02:28:36,640
RECENTLY LIKE COSTCO, WELLS 

3492
02:28:36,473 --> 02:28:40,177
FARGO.

3493
02:28:36,707 --> 02:28:41,879
WHERE IS THAT TAKING BERKSHIRE?

3494
02:28:40,244 --> 02:28:46,550
>> CHARLIE?

3495
02:28:41,946 --> 02:28:52,723
>> WE'RE NOT ALL THAT DIFFERENT.

3496
02:28:46,617 --> 02:28:55,192
AND COSTCO IS A COMPANY I VERY 

3497
02:28:52,790 --> 02:28:58,128
MUCH ADMIRE AND I HAVE ENJOYED 

3498
02:28:55,259 --> 02:29:01,265
MY LONG ASSOCIATION WITH IT, 

3499
02:28:58,195 --> 02:29:06,070
WITH THAT COMPANY.

3500
02:29:01,332 --> 02:29:17,481
AND BERKSHIRE, TOO.

3501
02:29:06,137 --> 02:29:17,915
SO -- AND LUCKILY THERE'S NO 

3502
02:29:17,548 --> 02:29:20,484
CONFLICT.

3503
02:29:17,982 --> 02:29:21,251

ARGUMENT.

3505
02:29:21,318 --> 02:29:23,687
62 YEARS.

3506
02:29:22,153 --> 02:29:27,992
IT'S NOT THAT WE AGREE ON 

3507
02:29:23,754 --> 02:29:29,893
EVERYTHING, BUT WE LITERALLY IN 

3508
02:29:28,059 --> 02:29:30,694
62 YEARS -- WE'VE NEVER GOTTEN 

3509
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:30,961
MAD AT EACH OTHER. 

3510
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:31,127
>> NO.

3511
02:29:31,027 --> 02:29:34,631
NO.

3512
02:29:31,194 --> 02:29:38,102

HE SAID MR. JAIN AND MR. ABEL, 

3516
02:29:41,004 --> 02:29:43,940
THIS QUESTION IS FOR YOU.

3517
02:29:42,039 --> 02:29:45,709
ONE OF THE SUCCESSFUL FEATURES 

3518
02:29:44,007 --> 02:29:47,944
IS THE STRONG BOND BETWEEN MR. 

3519
02:29:45,776 --> 02:29:49,847
BUFFETT AND MR. MUNGER WHO 

3520
02:29:48,011 --> 02:29:50,781
MANAGE IT BETTER BECAUSE THEY 

3521
02:29:49,913 --> 02:29:51,949
HAD EACH OTHER.

3522
02:29:50,848 --> 02:29:53,584
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US ABOUT HOW

3523
02:29:52,016 --> 02:29:56,420
YOU INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER OR 

3524
02:29:53,651 --> 02:29:59,790
SOME OF THE OTHER INCREDIBLY 

3525
02:29:56,487 --> 02:30:01,024
COMPETENT BERKSHIRE MANAGERS YOU

3526
02:29:59,857 --> 02:30:03,594
SEEK FOR ADVICE. 

3527
02:30:01,091 --> 02:30:05,496
>> WHO'S THAT DIRECTED AT?

3528
02:30:03,661 --> 02:30:05,929
>> AT GREG AND AJIT.

3529
02:30:05,563 --> 02:30:08,465
>> OKAY.

3530
02:30:05,996 --> 02:30:09,900
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION THE 

3531
02:30:08,532 --> 02:30:11,435
RELATIONSHIP WARREN HAS WITH 

3532
02:30:09,967 --> 02:30:13,470
CHARLIE IS UNIQUE.

3533
02:30:11,502 --> 02:30:15,372
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DUPLICATED,

3534
02:30:13,537 --> 02:30:17,174
CERTAINLY NOT BY ME AND GREG.

3535
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:19,209
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYBODY THAT 

3536
02:30:17,241 --> 02:30:20,911
CAN DUPLICATE T. NEVERTHELESS, 

3537
02:30:19,276 --> 02:30:22,345
BOTH GREG AND I, AT LEAST 

3538
02:30:20,978 --> 02:30:24,882
CERTAINLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE 

3539
02:30:22,412 --> 02:30:25,449
AND I'M SURE GREG WILL SPEAK FOR

3540
02:30:24,949 --> 02:30:26,650
HIMSELF.

3541
02:30:25,516 --> 02:30:27,317
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A 

3542
02:30:26,717 --> 02:30:29,086
VERY LONG TIME.

3543
02:30:27,384 --> 02:30:31,088
I CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF 

3544
02:30:29,153 --> 02:30:32,289
RESPECT, BOTH AT A PROFESSIONAL 

3545
02:30:31,155 --> 02:30:34,558
LEVEL AND PERSONAL LEVEL IN 

3546
02:30:32,356 --> 02:30:35,892
TERMS OF WHAT GREG'S ABILITIES 

3547
02:30:34,625 --> 02:30:37,861
ARE, WE DO NOT INTERACT WITH 

3548
02:30:35,959 --> 02:30:39,329
EACH OTHER AS OFTEN AS WARREN 

3549
02:30:37,928 --> 02:30:42,399
AND CHARLIE DO, BUT EVERY 

3550
02:30:39,396 --> 02:30:47,938
QUARTER WE WILL TALK TO EACH 

3551
02:30:42,466 --> 02:30:48,672
OTHER ABOUT OUR RESPECTIVE 

3552
02:30:48,005 --> 02:30:49,573
DECISIONS.

3553
02:30:48,739 --> 02:30:52,342
DURING THE COURSE OF THE QUARTER

3554
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:58,281
WHILE WE MAY NOT HAVE ANY FORMAL

3555
02:30:52,409 --> 02:30:59,950
MEETINGS, IF YOU WILL, BUT EVERY

3556
02:30:58,348 --> 02:31:00,584
TIME THEY'LL PICK UP THE PHONE 

3557
02:31:00,017 --> 02:31:02,653
AND CALL ME.

3558
02:31:00,651 --> 02:31:04,421
IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION RELATING

3559
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:05,922
TO THE NON-INSURANCE OPERATION 

3560
02:31:04,488 --> 02:31:07,357
THAT GREG IS IN CHARGE OF LIKE 

3561
02:31:05,989 --> 02:31:09,159
WE HAD RECENTLY WHERE A CLIENT 

3562
02:31:07,424 --> 02:31:10,360
OF MINE IS LOOKING FOR -- TRYING

3563
02:31:09,226 --> 02:31:12,362
TO FIND A BUYER.

3564
02:31:10,427 --> 02:31:13,864
I PICKED UP THE PHONE AND TALKED

3565
02:31:12,429 --> 02:31:14,598
TO GREG ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HOW 

3566
02:31:13,931 --> 02:31:16,700
BEST TO PROCEED.

3567
02:31:14,665 --> 02:31:17,534
SO THERE'S THAT THAT HAPPENS 

3568
02:31:16,767 --> 02:31:17,801
DURING THE COURSE OF THE 

3569
02:31:17,601 --> 02:31:23,440
QUARTER.

3570
02:31:17,868 --> 02:31:25,642
EVERY QUARTER WE EXCHANGE NOTES.

3571
02:31:23,507 --> 02:31:26,577
WE HAVE A PERFECTLY 

3572
02:31:25,709 --> 02:31:27,944
WELL-FUNCTIONING RELATIONSHIP 

3573
02:31:26,644 --> 02:31:29,713
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, AND I 

3574
02:31:28,011 --> 02:31:30,180
HOPE IT REMAINS THAT WAY.

3575
02:31:29,780 --> 02:31:31,048
GREG?

3576
02:31:30,247 --> 02:31:32,950
>> YES.

3577
02:31:31,115 --> 02:31:36,353
WELL, AJIT, WELL SAID.

3578
02:31:33,017 --> 02:31:38,956
AND AS HE TOUCHED ON, WARREN AND

3579
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:39,690
CHARLIE HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL 

3580
02:31:39,023 --> 02:31:40,024
RELAT

3581
02:31:39,757 --> 02:31:41,124
RELATIONSHIP.

3582
02:31:40,090 --> 02:31:42,126
VERY PROUD OF THE RELATIONSHIP 

3583
02:31:41,191 --> 02:31:44,227
I'VE HAD.

3584
02:31:42,193 --> 02:31:45,496
AS AJIT TOUCHED ON, IT'S 

3585
02:31:44,294 --> 02:31:47,397
DEVELOPED OVER MANY YEARS.

3586
02:31:45,563 --> 02:31:50,834
WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OR 

3587
02:31:47,464 --> 02:31:56,607
I'VE SEEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE

3588
02:31:50,901 --> 02:31:57,941
HOW AJIT'S ONE THE BUSINESS.

3589
02:31:56,674 --> 02:31:58,442
I'VE HAD THE ABILITY TO OBSERVE 

3590
02:31:58,008 --> 02:32:01,044
THAT.

3591
02:31:58,509 --> 02:32:02,179
EQUALLY OVER THE YEARS THAT 

3592
02:32:01,111 --> 02:32:04,582
RELATIONSHIP HAS JUST BUILT AND 

3593
02:32:02,246 --> 02:32:07,918
BECOME GREATER AND GREATER AND 

3594
02:32:04,648 --> 02:32:09,219
AS AJIT TOUCHED ON, I HAVE MORE 

3595
02:32:07,985 --> 02:32:10,888
RESPECT FOR HIM BOTH PERSONALLY 

3596
02:32:09,286 --> 02:32:12,322
AND PROFESSIONALLY.

3597
02:32:10,955 --> 02:32:13,990
EVEN THOUGH THE INTERACTION MAY 

3598
02:32:12,389 --> 02:32:16,059
BE DIFFERENT THAN SAY HOW WARREN

3599
02:32:14,057 --> 02:32:19,830
AND CHARLIE DO IT, AS AJIT 

3600
02:32:16,126 --> 02:32:20,664
TOUCHED ON, THERE IS A REGULAR 

3601
02:32:19,897 --> 02:32:22,465
DIALOGUE BOTH AROUND 

3602
02:32:20,731 --> 02:32:28,338
OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR TWO 

3603
02:32:22,532 --> 02:32:29,907
BUSINESSES AND UNITS, BOTH IF WE

3604
02:32:28,405 --> 02:32:31,408
SEE INDIVIDUAL SHOOTS THERE.

3605
02:32:29,974 --> 02:32:32,809
WE MAKE SURE WE'RE ALWAYS 

3606
02:32:31,474 --> 02:32:34,144
FOLLOWING UP WITH EACH OTHER BUT

3607
02:32:32,876 --> 02:32:36,780
IT GOES BEYOND THAT.

3608
02:32:34,211 --> 02:32:38,215
AJIT HAS A GREAT UNDERSTANDING 

3609
02:32:36,847 --> 02:32:39,750
OF THE BERKSHIRE CULTURE.

3610
02:32:38,282 --> 02:32:41,752
I STRONGLY BELIEVE I DO, TOO.

3611
02:32:39,817 --> 02:32:45,255
ANY TIME WE SEE ANYTHING UNUSUAL

3612
02:32:41,819 --> 02:32:46,256
IN ONE OF OUR BUSINESSES, IT'S 

3613
02:32:45,322 --> 02:32:47,724
AJIT WHO I'M GOING TO CALL AND 

3614
02:32:46,323 --> 02:32:51,995
SAY ARE YOU COMFORTABLE THAT 

3615
02:32:47,791 --> 02:32:54,931
WE'RE TAKING THIS APPROACH?

3616
02:32:52,062 --> 02:32:55,933
IS IT CONSISTENT WITH HOW YOU 

3617
02:32:54,998 --> 02:32:57,601
THINK ABOUT IT.

3618
02:32:55,999 --> 02:32:59,035
IT GOES BEYOND DISCUSSING THE 

3619
02:32:57,668 --> 02:33:00,804
BUSINESSES BUT THAT MAINTAINING 

3620
02:32:59,102 --> 02:33:02,806
THE EXCEPTIONAL CULTURE WE HAVE 

3621
02:33:00,871 --> 02:33:03,006
AT BERKSHIRE AND BUILDING UPON 

3622
02:33:02,873 --> 02:33:06,443
THAT.

3623
02:33:03,073 --> 02:33:08,511
VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE AJIT AS A

3624
02:33:06,509 --> 02:33:11,782
COLLEAGUE AND IMMENSELY ENJOY 

3625
02:33:08,578 --> 02:33:12,349
WORKING WITH HIM EVERY DAY.

3626
02:33:11,849 --> 02:33:15,285
THANK YOU.

3627
02:33:12,416 --> 02:33:15,552
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM GLEN

3628
02:33:15,352 --> 02:33:17,120
GREENBERG.

3629
02:33:15,619 --> 02:33:19,456
HE SAYS -- IT'S ON THE 

3630
02:33:17,187 --> 02:33:22,192
PROFITABILITY OF GEICO AND BNSF.

3631
02:33:19,523 --> 02:33:23,627
HE SAID WHY DO THEY OPERATE AT 

3632
02:33:22,259 --> 02:33:24,895
MEANINGFULLY LOWER PROFIT 

3633
02:33:23,693 --> 02:33:26,696
MARGINS THAN THEIR MAIN 

3634
02:33:24,961 --> 02:33:27,598
COMPETITORS, PROGRESSIVE AND 

3635
02:33:26,763 --> 02:33:30,267
UNION PACIFIC?

3636
02:33:27,665 --> 02:33:31,735
CAN WE EXPECT CURRENT MANAGEMENT

3637
02:33:30,334 --> 02:33:33,169
TO ACHIEVE PARITY?

3638
02:33:31,802 --> 02:33:34,571
>> GEICO AND -- 

3639
02:33:33,236 --> 02:33:36,373
>> BNSF.

3640
02:33:34,638 --> 02:33:40,510
>> OH, ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT 

3641
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:45,982
THE FIRST QUARTER FIGURES YOU'LL

3642
02:33:40,577 --> 02:33:49,720
SEE THAT THE BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY 

3643
02:33:46,049 --> 02:33:49,953
UNION PACIFIC PERSON HAS GOTTEN 

3644
02:33:49,787 --> 02:33:52,055
BETTER.

3645
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:55,959
K.T. FARMER IS DOING AN 

3646
02:33:52,122 --> 02:33:57,094
INCREDIBLE JOB AT BNSF.

3647
02:33:56,026 --> 02:33:58,795
BE AN INTERESTING QUESTION 

3648
02:33:57,160 --> 02:34:01,731
WHETHER FIVE YEARS FROM NOW OR 

3649
02:33:58,862 --> 02:34:04,334
15 YEARS FROM NOW BNSF OR UNION 

3650
02:34:01,798 --> 02:34:06,169
PACIFIC HAS HAD HIGHER EARNINGS.

3651
02:34:04,401 --> 02:34:06,470
WE'VE HAD HIGHER EARNINGS IN THE

3652
02:34:06,236 --> 02:34:12,676
PAST.

3653
02:34:06,537 --> 02:34:14,978
THE FIRST QUARTER YOU CAN LOOK 

3654
02:34:12,743 --> 02:34:17,681
AT AND, YOU KNOW, THEY THINK 

3655
02:34:15,045 --> 02:34:17,948
THEY'VE GOT A SLIGHTLY BETTER 

3656
02:34:17,748 --> 02:34:19,983
FRANCHISE.

3657
02:34:18,015 --> 02:34:21,318
WE THINK WE'VE GOT A SLIGHTLY 

3658
02:34:20,050 --> 02:34:23,520
BETTER FRANCHISE.

3659
02:34:21,385 --> 02:34:24,321
WE'RE LARGER THAN UNION PACIFIC.

3660
02:34:23,587 --> 02:34:27,424
WE SHOULD.

3661
02:34:24,388 --> 02:34:29,660
WE SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE MORE 

3662
02:34:27,491 --> 02:34:33,730
MONEY THAN WE DID BUT WE HAVEN'T

3663
02:34:29,727 --> 02:34:35,766
THE LAST FEW YEARS.

3664
02:34:33,797 --> 02:34:37,901
IT'S QUITE A RARE ROAD.

3665
02:34:35,833 --> 02:34:42,139
I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THAT.

3666
02:34:37,968 --> 02:34:42,406
I SHOULD GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS

3667
02:34:42,206 --> 02:34:44,074
QUESTION.

3668
02:34:42,473 --> 02:34:44,341
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE AGING 

3669
02:34:44,141 --> 02:34:47,010
CULTURE.

3670
02:34:44,408 --> 02:34:47,444
I ASSUME THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT 

3671
02:34:47,077 --> 02:34:49,913
CHARLIE.

3672
02:34:47,511 --> 02:34:51,682
I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT IN 

3673
02:34:49,980 --> 02:34:53,883
THREE MORE YEARS CHARLIE WILL BE

3674
02:34:51,749 --> 02:34:59,656
AGING AT 1% A YEAR AND HE IS 

3675
02:34:53,950 --> 02:34:59,923
THE -- NO ONE'S AGING LESS THAN 

3676
02:34:59,723 --> 02:35:01,725
CHARLIE.

3677
02:34:59,990 --> 02:35:03,427
IF YOU COULD TAKE SOME OF THESE 

3678
02:35:01,791 --> 02:35:05,462
NEW COMPANIES WITH 25-YEAR-OLDS,

3679
02:35:03,494 --> 02:35:08,765
THEY'RE AGING AT 4% A YEAR.

3680
02:35:05,529 --> 02:35:10,600
WE WILL HAVE THE SLOWEST AGING 

3681
02:35:08,832 --> 02:35:12,702
MANAGEMENT PERCENTAGEWISE BY FAR

3682
02:35:10,667 --> 02:35:16,440
THAN ANY CORPORATE COMPANY -- 

3683
02:35:12,769 --> 02:35:18,274
ANY AMERICAN COMPANY HAS.

3684
02:35:16,507 --> 02:35:19,642
>> DID YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT 

3685
02:35:18,341 --> 02:35:21,978
GEICO VERSUS PROGRESSIVE?

3686
02:35:19,709 --> 02:35:23,680
I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON 

3687
02:35:22,045 --> 02:35:26,016
THAT PROGRESSIVE HAS HAD THE 

3688
02:35:23,747 --> 02:35:27,517
BEST OPERATION IN THE LAST -- IN

3689
02:35:26,083 --> 02:35:29,086
RECENT YEARS IN TERMS OF 

3690
02:35:27,584 --> 02:35:30,987
MATCHING RATE TO RISK.

3691
02:35:29,153 --> 02:35:33,890
THAT'S WHAT INSURANCE IS ALL 

3692
02:35:31,054 --> 02:35:35,926
ABOUT, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

3693
02:35:33,957 --> 02:35:38,061
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT RATE.

3694
02:35:35,993 --> 02:35:39,162
IF YOU THINK 90-YEAR-OLDS AND 

3695
02:35:38,128 --> 02:35:40,898
20-YEAR-OLDS HAVE AN EQUAL 

3696
02:35:39,229 --> 02:35:42,566
CHANCE OF DYING, YOU'RE GOING TO

3697
02:35:40,964 --> 02:35:44,067
BE OUT OF BUSINESS VERY QUICKLY,

3698
02:35:42,633 --> 02:35:46,002
THE LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS.

3699
02:35:44,134 --> 02:35:47,871
YOU WILL GET ALL OF THE 

3700
02:35:46,069 --> 02:35:53,176
90-YEAR-OLD RISKS AND THE OTHER 

3701
02:35:47,938 --> 02:35:53,710
GUY WILL GET ALL OF THE AUTO 

3702
02:35:53,243 --> 02:35:55,412
INSURANCE.

3703
02:35:53,777 --> 02:35:56,747
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

3704
02:35:55,479 --> 02:36:01,818
60-YEAR-OLD MALES AND 

3705
02:35:56,814 --> 02:36:02,051
40-YEAR-OLD MARRIED, EMPLOYED 

3706
02:36:01,885 --> 02:36:05,054
PEOPLE.

3707
02:36:02,118 --> 02:36:08,958
SO THE COMPANIES THAT DO THE 

3708
02:36:05,121 --> 02:36:10,393
BEST JOB OF ACTUALLY HAVING THE 

3709
02:36:09,025 --> 02:36:12,228
APPROPRIATE RATE FOR EVERY ONE 

3710
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:13,764
OF THEIR POLICYHOLDERS IS GOING 

3711
02:36:12,295 --> 02:36:16,366
TO DO VERY WELL.

3712
02:36:13,831 --> 02:36:17,801
PROGRESSIVE HAS DONE A VERY GOOD

3713
02:36:16,433 --> 02:36:21,872
JOB AT THAT.

3714
02:36:17,868 --> 02:36:25,342
WE'RE DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB ON

3715
02:36:21,939 --> 02:36:27,978
THAT ALREADY.

3716
02:36:25,409 --> 02:36:30,847
TODD COMBS HAS GONE THERE.

3717
02:36:28,045 --> 02:36:35,218
VERY INTERESTING BUSINESS.

3718
02:36:30,914 --> 02:36:39,790
BOTH PROGRESSIVE AND GEICO WERE 

3719
02:36:35,285 --> 02:36:41,524
STARTED IN THE 30s.

3720
02:36:39,857 --> 02:36:43,459
WE HAVE HAD THE BETTER PRODUCT 

3721
02:36:41,591 --> 02:36:47,798
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME IN TERMS 

3722
02:36:43,526 --> 02:36:52,869
OF COST AND HERE WE ARE 85 YEARS

3723
02:36:47,865 --> 02:36:57,540
LATER IN OUR CASE AND WE HAVE 

3724
02:36:52,936 --> 02:36:59,876
ABOUT 13% OR SO IN THE MARKET, 

3725
02:36:57,607 --> 02:37:00,143
THE TWO ARE AT 25% IN THE 

3726
02:36:59,943 --> 02:37:01,879
MARKET.

3727
02:37:00,210 --> 02:37:04,280
THE HUGE MARKET AFTER 87 YEARS 

3728
02:37:01,945 --> 02:37:06,115
OF HAVING A BETTER PRODUCT, SO 

3729
02:37:04,347 --> 02:37:07,150
IT'S A VERY SLOW CHANGING 

3730
02:37:06,182 --> 02:37:08,985
COMPETITIVE SITUATION BUT 

3731
02:37:07,217 --> 02:37:10,420
PROGRESSIVE HAS DONE A VERY, 

3732
02:37:09,052 --> 02:37:13,990
VERY GOOD JOB RECENTLY.

3733
02:37:10,487 --> 02:37:17,761
WE'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OVER 

3734
02:37:14,057 --> 02:37:19,696
THE YEARS.

3735
02:37:17,828 --> 02:37:22,199
WE HAVE MADE SOME ARE VERY 

3736
02:37:19,763 --> 02:37:23,633
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT.

3737
02:37:22,266 --> 02:37:24,568
OUR PROFITABILITY IN THE FIRST 

3738
02:37:23,700 --> 02:37:26,536
QUARTER WAS GOOD.

3739
02:37:24,635 --> 02:37:30,907
BUT WE GAVE BACK MORE MONEY 

3740
02:37:26,603 --> 02:37:33,776
UNDER OUR GIVEBACK ARRANGEMENT 

3741
02:37:30,974 --> 02:37:35,812
WHEN THE VIRUS BROKE OUT, 2.8 

3742
02:37:33,843 --> 02:37:37,314
BILLION ON THE GIVEBACK PROGRAM 

3743
02:37:35,879 --> 02:37:37,981
THAT WAS LARGER THAN ANY COMPANY

3744
02:37:37,381 --> 02:37:39,716
AS WELL.

3745
02:37:38,048 --> 02:37:43,186
ONE OF THE LARGEST, I THINK, IN 

3746
02:37:39,783 --> 02:37:46,022
THE COUNTRY.

3747
02:37:43,253 --> 02:37:47,324
AND GEICO AND PROGRESSIVE ARE 

3748
02:37:46,089 --> 02:37:48,558
BOTH GOING TO DO VERY WELL IN 

3749
02:37:47,390 --> 02:37:50,827
THE FUTURE.

3750
02:37:48,625 --> 02:37:52,562
UNION PACIFIC AND BNSF ARE GOING

3751
02:37:50,894 --> 02:37:54,297
TO DO WELL IN THE FUTURE.

3752
02:37:52,629 --> 02:37:55,632
IN EACH CASE WE WANT TO DO 

3753
02:37:54,364 --> 02:37:56,266
BETTER THAN THE OTHER GUY. 

3754
02:37:55,699 --> 02:37:56,866
>> CAN I JUST -- 

3755
02:37:56,333 --> 02:37:58,701
>> YEAH. 

3756
02:37:56,933 --> 02:38:00,070
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION 

3757
02:37:58,768 --> 02:38:02,839
PROGRESSIVE IS A MACHINE.

3758
02:38:00,137 --> 02:38:03,240
THEY ARE VERY GOOD AT WHAT THEY 

3759
02:38:02,906 --> 02:38:04,607
DO.

3760
02:38:03,307 --> 02:38:05,475
UNDERWRITING IN TERMS OF WHAT 

3761
02:38:04,674 --> 02:38:09,846
WARREN TALKED ABOUT.

3762
02:38:05,542 --> 02:38:11,448
HAVING SAID THAT, I THINK GEICO 

3763
02:38:09,913 --> 02:38:13,416
IS CATCHING UP WITH PROGRESSIVE.

3764
02:38:11,515 --> 02:38:15,986
MORE THAN A YEAR AGO -- ABOUT A 

3765
02:38:13,483 --> 02:38:18,889
YEAR AGO PROGRESSIVE HAD MARGINS

3766
02:38:16,053 --> 02:38:24,561
ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS GEICO.

3767
02:38:18,956 --> 02:38:25,295
GROWTH RATES TWICE AS MUCH AS 

3768
02:38:24,628 --> 02:38:27,297
GEICOS.

3769
02:38:25,362 --> 02:38:28,498
IF YOU LOOK AT IT NOW, 

3770
02:38:27,364 --> 02:38:29,633
PROGRESSIVE IS CRUSHING IT IN 

3771
02:38:28,565 --> 02:38:31,267
TERMS OF GROWTH.

3772
02:38:29,700 --> 02:38:34,104
GEICO HAS CAUGHT UP WITH 

3773
02:38:31,334 --> 02:38:38,575
PROGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF MARGIN.

3774
02:38:34,171 --> 02:38:38,909
HOPEFULLY THAT GAP WILL BE 

3775
02:38:38,642 --> 02:38:44,714
NONEXISTENT. 

3776
02:38:38,975 --> 02:38:47,450
>> THE SECOND I WANT TO TALK 

3777
02:38:44,781 --> 02:38:49,118
ABOUT IS THE VALUE.

3778
02:38:47,517 --> 02:38:53,356
THEY HAVE WOKEN UP TO THE FACT 

3779
02:38:49,185 --> 02:38:53,556
THAT TELEMATICS HAS PLAYED A BIG

3780
02:38:53,423 --> 02:38:55,124
ROLE.

3781
02:38:53,623 --> 02:38:56,092
THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF 

3782
02:38:55,191 --> 02:38:58,161
INITIATIVES AND HOPEFULLY WILL 

3783
02:38:56,159 --> 02:39:01,497
SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY BEFORE NOT 

3784
02:38:58,228 --> 02:39:01,965
TOO LONG AND WILL ALLOW THEM TO 

3785
02:39:01,564 --> 02:39:03,666
CATCH UP. 

3786
02:39:02,031 --> 02:39:05,201
>> I WILL PREDICT THAT FIVE 

3787
02:39:03,733 --> 02:39:07,671
YEARS FROM NOW STATE FARM IS 

3788
02:39:05,268 --> 02:39:10,406
STILL THE LARGEST AUTO INSURER.

3789
02:39:07,738 --> 02:39:12,609
I WILL PREDICT THAT FIVE YEARS 

3790
02:39:10,473 --> 02:39:15,812
FROM NOW IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT 

3791
02:39:12,676 --> 02:39:17,280
THE TOP TWO WILL BE GEICO AND 

3792
02:39:15,879 --> 02:39:19,749
PROGRESSIVE AND IN WHICH ORDER 

3793
02:39:17,347 --> 02:39:28,458
WE'LL SEE, BUT BOTH COMPANIES 

3794
02:39:19,816 --> 02:39:31,728
ARE GOING TO DO VERY WELL IN MY

3795
02:39:28,525 --> 02:39:33,063
GEICO'S DONE EXTREMELY WELL BUT 

3796
02:39:31,794 --> 02:39:34,798
PROGRESSIVE WAS BETTER AT 

3797
02:39:33,129 --> 02:39:39,235
SETTING THE RIGHT RATE AND WE'RE

3798
02:39:34,865 --> 02:39:39,468
CATCHING UP, I THINK FAIRLY 

3799
02:39:39,302 --> 02:39:40,637
FAST.

3800
02:39:39,535 --> 02:39:41,938
>> EXCUSE ME.

3801
02:39:40,704 --> 02:39:44,174
PROGRESSIVE HAS DONE BETTER BUT 

3802
02:39:42,004 --> 02:39:46,343
WHEN IT COMES TO BRANDING, 

3803
02:39:44,241 --> 02:39:48,612
GEICO, I THINK, IS MILES AHEAD 

3804
02:39:46,409 --> 02:39:51,848
OF PROGRESSIVE AND IN TERMS OF 

3805
02:39:48,679 --> 02:39:53,517
MANAGING EXPENSES, I THINK GEICO

3806
02:39:51,915 --> 02:39:55,051
DOES A MUCH BETTER JONATHAN 

3807
02:39:53,583 --> 02:39:59,522
ANYONE ELSE IN THE INDUSTRY.

3808
02:39:55,118 --> 02:40:03,259
>>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM 

3809
02:39:59,589 --> 02:40:06,363
AGRIRCI FROM SWEATSHIRTSERLAND.

3810
02:40:03,326 --> 02:40:07,897
DID BERKSHIRE SELL SOME OF THE 

3811
02:40:06,429 --> 02:40:11,101
DEMONSTRATE STOCKS?

3812
02:40:07,964 --> 02:40:14,104
WHY DIDN'T BERKSHIRE BUY MORE 

3813
02:40:11,168 --> 02:40:17,607
APPLE STOCKS IN 2020?

3814
02:40:14,171 --> 02:40:17,907
THIS SEEMS TO BE COUNTERINTU 

3815
02:40:17,674 --> 02:40:20,677
ACTIVE.

3816
02:40:17,974 --> 02:40:21,444
>>> WE HAVE 5.3% OR SOMETHING 

3817
02:40:20,743 --> 02:40:24,280
RIGHT NOW.

3818
02:40:21,511 --> 02:40:26,316
WE PAT IN OUR SHARES WHICH HELPS

3819
02:40:24,347 --> 02:40:28,952
OUR OWN SHAREHOLDERS EXPAND 

3820
02:40:26,382 --> 02:40:31,421
THEIR INTEREST IN APPLE WITHOUT 

3821
02:40:29,018 --> 02:40:33,623
LAYING OUT A PENNY AND APPLE 

3822
02:40:31,488 --> 02:40:36,493
JUST ANNOUNCED ANOTHER 

3823
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:38,561
REPURCHASE PROGRAM, SO LET'S SAY

3824
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:42,666
TSH WE LOOK AT APPLE, THE 

3825
02:40:38,628 --> 02:40:45,001
BUSINESS THAT WE OWN, 5.3%.

3826
02:40:42,733 --> 02:40:48,138
WE'VE GOT -- IT'S A MARKETABLE 

3827
02:40:45,068 --> 02:40:49,706
SECURITY, SO IT SHOWS UP AS WAY 

3828
02:40:48,205 --> 02:40:50,940
GREATER THAT ANY OTHER 

3829
02:40:49,773 --> 02:40:54,544
MARKETABLE SECURITY WE HAVE, BUT

3830
02:40:51,007 --> 02:40:56,846
OF COURSE, IF YOU LOOK AT OUR 

3831
02:40:54,611 --> 02:40:59,216
RAILROAD, AND WE MENTIONED -- 

3832
02:40:56,913 --> 02:41:01,251
WELL YUP PACIFIC IS SELLING FOR 

3833
02:40:59,282 --> 02:41:03,653
ABOUT 150 BILLION IN THE MARK.

3834
02:41:01,318 --> 02:41:05,588
WE TOOK ONE THAT TOOK LARGER 

3835
02:41:03,719 --> 02:41:10,994
THAN UNION PACIFIC AND MAKING IT

3836
02:41:05,655 --> 02:41:15,732
LESS MONEY, BUT NOT MUCH LESS.

3837
02:41:11,061 --> 02:41:17,767
SO IT'S A -- IT'S AN 

3838
02:41:15,798 --> 02:41:23,073
EXTRAORDINARILY APPLE -- IT'S 

3839
02:41:17,834 --> 02:41:24,841
GOT -- GOT A FANTASTIC -- HE WAS

3840
02:41:23,140 --> 02:41:27,444
UNDER APPRECIATED FOR A WHILE.

3841
02:41:24,908 --> 02:41:29,545
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF MANAGERS, 

3842
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:31,648
HE'S ONE OF THE BEST.

3843
02:41:29,612 --> 02:41:32,382
HE'S GOT A PRODUCT THAT PEOPLE 

3844
02:41:31,715 --> 02:41:35,785
ABSOLUTELY LOVE.

3845
02:41:32,449 --> 02:41:39,355
THERE'S A SOLID BASE OF PEOPLE 

3846
02:41:35,852 --> 02:41:42,459
AND THE DISSATISFACTION RATES OF

3847
02:41:39,422 --> 02:41:46,028
99% AND I GET THE FIGURES FROM 

3848
02:41:42,525 --> 02:41:47,564
FURNITURE MART AS TO WHAT'S 

3849
02:41:46,095 --> 02:41:51,267
BEING SOLD.

3850
02:41:47,631 --> 02:41:52,836
IF PEOPLE COME IN THEY WANT 

3851
02:41:51,334 --> 02:41:55,338
ANDROID PHONE.

3852
02:41:52,903 --> 02:41:57,741
IF THEY WANT AN APPLE, YOU 

3853
02:41:55,405 --> 02:41:59,442
CAN'T -- THE BRAND AND THE 

3854
02:41:57,808 --> 02:42:02,912
PRODUCT, IT'S AN INBREBL 

3855
02:41:59,509 --> 02:42:03,780
PRODUCT, A HUMAN, HUGE BARGAIN 

3856
02:42:02,979 --> 02:42:05,949
TO PEOPLE.

3857
02:42:03,847 --> 02:42:07,050
THE PART IT PLAYS IN THEIR LIVES

3858
02:42:06,016 --> 02:42:09,219
IS HUGE.

3859
02:42:07,117 --> 02:42:12,055
I USE IT AS A PHONE.

3860
02:42:09,286 --> 02:42:13,089
I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN THE 

3861
02:42:12,122 --> 02:42:15,825
COUNTRY, MAYBE ALEXANDER GRAHAM 

3862
02:42:13,156 --> 02:42:17,894
BELL IS DOING THE SAME THING, 

3863
02:42:15,892 --> 02:42:22,532
BUT IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO 

3864
02:42:17,961 --> 02:42:24,968
PEOPLE, AND IT COSTS -- COSTS 

3865
02:42:22,599 --> 02:42:27,403
$35,000 AND I'M SURE SOME PEOPLE

3866
02:42:25,035 --> 02:42:31,575
WILL BE ASKING IF THEY HAD TO 

3867
02:42:27,470 --> 02:42:33,777
GIVE UP THEIR APPLE OR GIVE UP 

3868
02:42:31,641 --> 02:42:35,145
THE CAR, YOU KNOW, AND REALLY 

3869
02:42:33,843 --> 02:42:36,112
MAKE THE CHOICE FOR THE NEXT 

3870
02:42:35,211 --> 02:42:38,114
FIVE YEARS.

3871
02:42:36,179 --> 02:42:40,316
WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY DO?

3872
02:42:38,181 --> 02:42:47,023
BUT IT IS -- AND WE GOT A CHANCE

3873
02:42:40,383 --> 02:42:49,726
TO BUY IT AND I SOLD SOME STOCK 

3874
02:42:47,089 --> 02:42:50,860
LAST YEAR, ALTHOUGH OUR 

3875
02:42:49,793 --> 02:42:52,996
SHAREHOLDERS HAD THEIR 

3876
02:42:50,927 --> 02:42:53,930
PERCENTAGE GO UP BECAUSE WE 

3877
02:42:53,063 --> 02:42:56,599
REPURCHASED SHARE.

3878
02:42:53,997 --> 02:43:00,303
BUT THAT WAS PROBABLY A MISTAKE.

3879
02:42:56,666 --> 02:43:02,839
IN FACT, CHARLIE IN HIS USUAL 

3880
02:43:00,370 --> 02:43:05,241
LOW-KEY WAY LET ME KNOW THAT HE 

3881
02:43:02,905 --> 02:43:06,709
THOUGHT IT WAS A MISTAKE, TOO, 

3882
02:43:05,308 --> 02:43:07,477
DIDN'T YOU CHARLIE?

3883
02:43:06,776 --> 02:43:09,679
>> YES.

3884
02:43:07,544 --> 02:43:11,982
>> I COULD ONLY DO SO MANY 

3885
02:43:09,746 --> 02:43:14,884
THINGS THAT I CAN GET AWAY WITH 

3886
02:43:12,048 --> 02:43:19,556
CHARLIE AND I KIND OF USED THEM 

3887
02:43:14,951 --> 02:43:22,459
UP BETWEEN COSTCO AND APPLE.

3888
02:43:19,623 --> 02:43:25,128
SO -- AND VERY LIKELY WAS RIGHT 

3889
02:43:22,525 --> 02:43:28,331
IN BOTH CIRCUMSTANCES.

3890
02:43:25,195 --> 02:43:35,738
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS.

3891
02:43:28,398 --> 02:43:40,376
BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT 

3892
02:43:35,805 --> 02:43:43,046
IN ITS OWN WAY, IT'S A DIFFERENT

3893
02:43:40,443 --> 02:43:45,015
WAY, BUT TEN FOCUS -- WE SEE A 

3894
02:43:43,112 --> 02:43:47,050
LOT OF MANAGERS OF A LOT OF 

3895
02:43:45,081 --> 02:43:49,485
BUSINESSES AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT

3896
02:43:47,117 --> 02:43:49,853
TWO GREAT ONES ON BOTH ENDS 

3897
02:43:49,552 --> 02:43:53,056
HERE.

3898
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:53,990
HE'S HANDLED THAT BUSINESS SO 

3899
02:43:53,123 --> 02:43:55,558
WELL.

3900
02:43:54,057 --> 02:44:01,598
HE COULDN'T DO WHAT STEVE JOBS 

3901
02:43:55,625 --> 02:44:01,898
OBVIOUSLY COULD DO IN TERMS OF 

3902
02:44:01,665 --> 02:44:04,067
CREATION.

3903
02:44:01,965 --> 02:44:06,069
BUT I DON'T -- BUT STEVE JOBS 

3904
02:44:04,134 --> 02:44:09,472
COULDN'T REALLY, I DON'T THINK, 

3905
02:44:06,135 --> 02:44:10,173
DO WHAT TIM COOK WAS DONE IN 

3906
02:44:09,538 --> 02:44:12,876
MANY RESPECTS.

3907
02:44:10,240 --> 02:44:16,980
>> I ALSO THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT 

3908
02:44:12,943 --> 02:44:18,615
THAT LIST YOU SHOWED OF THE 

3909
02:44:17,046 --> 02:44:19,883
AMERICAN COMPANIES, IT'S BEEN 

3910
02:44:18,682 --> 02:44:23,086
VERY IMPORTANT FOR AMERICA THAT 

3911
02:44:19,949 --> 02:44:25,488
WE'VE DONE SO WELL IN THIS NEW 

3912
02:44:23,153 --> 02:44:28,725
TECH FIELD AND I PERSONALLY 

3913
02:44:25,555 --> 02:44:30,326
WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE OUR 

3914
02:44:28,792 --> 02:44:34,931
PRESENT GIANTS BROUGHT DOWN TO 

3915
02:44:30,393 --> 02:44:35,231
SOME LOW LEVEL BY SOME 

3916
02:44:34,998 --> 02:44:37,000
REASONINGS.

3917
02:44:35,298 --> 02:44:38,868
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE DOING A 

3918
02:44:37,066 --> 02:44:39,736
LOT OF HARM, ANYWAY, A 

3919
02:44:38,935 --> 02:44:41,571
COMPETITIVE ONE.

3920
02:44:39,803 --> 02:44:43,873
I THINK THERE'S A CREDIT TO 

3921
02:44:41,638 --> 02:44:44,207
AMERICANS, CREDIT TO OUR 

3922
02:44:43,940 --> 02:44:45,008
CIVILIZATION.

3923
02:44:44,273 --> 02:44:46,609
AND THEY'RE HUGE.

3924
02:44:45,075 --> 02:44:50,346
AND THEY'RE HUGE, AND THAT'S 

3925
02:44:46,675 --> 02:44:53,983
GOOD FOR US.

3926
02:44:50,413 --> 02:44:54,717
>> WELL, LET ME ASK A FOLLOW-UP 

3927
02:44:54,050 --> 02:44:58,187
QUESTION.

3928
02:44:54,784 --> 02:45:00,924
THIS COMES FROM JACK ZANE WHO 

3929
02:44:58,254 --> 02:45:04,327
SAYS WHAT'S YOUR MIND SET WHEN 

3930
02:45:00,991 --> 02:45:10,900
YOU SEE THESE HIGH FLYERS.

3931
02:45:04,394 --> 02:45:13,169
THE BIG TECH GROWTH STOCKS, 200%

3932
02:45:10,967 --> 02:45:17,807
ETC. IN A MATTER OF OR LESS.

3933
02:45:13,236 --> 02:45:19,342
HOW DO YOU ASSESS IF THESE HIGH 

3934
02:45:17,874 --> 02:45:19,742
FLYERS ARE CAPABLE OF 

3935
02:45:19,409 --> 02:45:23,212
INVESTMENT?

3936
02:45:19,809 --> 02:45:26,049
>> WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE CRAZY.

3937
02:45:23,279 --> 02:45:31,921
BUT WE DON'T -- AT LEAST 

3938
02:45:26,116 --> 02:45:34,724
CHARLIE -- I FEEL THAT I 

3939
02:45:31,987 --> 02:45:38,695
UNDERSTAND APPLE AND IT'S FUTCH 

3940
02:45:34,790 --> 02:45:40,129
WITH CONSUMERS AROUND THE WORLD 

3941
02:45:38,761 --> 02:45:45,668
BETTER THAN I UNDERSTAND SOME OF

3942
02:45:40,196 --> 02:45:48,771
THE OTHERS, BUT I DON'T REGARD 

3943
02:45:45,735 --> 02:45:52,175
PRICES AND THAT GETS BACK -- 

3944
02:45:48,838 --> 02:45:52,909
WELL, IT GETS BACK TO SOMETHING 

3945
02:45:52,242 --> 02:45:56,546
FUNDAMENTAL AS INVESTMENTS.

3946
02:45:52,976 --> 02:46:00,450
I MEAN, INTEREST RATES, YOU 

3947
02:45:56,613 --> 02:46:02,952
KNOW, BASICALLY ARE TO THE VALUE

3948
02:46:00,517 --> 02:46:07,323
OF ASSETS WHAT GRAVITY IS TO 

3949
02:46:03,019 --> 02:46:09,926
MATTER, ESSENTIALLY, AND ON THE 

3950
02:46:07,390 --> 02:46:11,661
WAY OUT HERE, I TORE OUT A 

3951
02:46:09,992 --> 02:46:13,129
LITTLE CLIPPING FROM THE WALL 

3952
02:46:11,728 --> 02:46:15,264
STREET JOURNAL YESTERDAY.

3953
02:46:13,196 --> 02:46:17,266
PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE READ IT, 

3954
02:46:15,331 --> 02:46:17,700
SO SMALL, HAVE TROUBLE FINDING 

3955
02:46:17,333 --> 02:46:21,071
IT.

3956
02:46:17,767 --> 02:46:25,875
BUT ANYWAY, ON THURSDAY, THE 

3957
02:46:21,137 --> 02:46:31,514
U.S. PRESSURERY SOLD SOME 

3958
02:46:25,942 --> 02:46:32,648
EIGHT -- SOME FOUR WEEK NOTES 

3959
02:46:31,581 --> 02:46:36,052
TREASURE BILLS AND THE PRICE 

3960
02:46:32,715 --> 02:46:37,854
WAS -- IF YOU LOOKED AT THE WALL

3961
02:46:36,119 --> 02:46:39,222
STREET JOURNAL IN A LITTLE 

3962
02:46:37,921 --> 02:46:42,925
CORNER NEXT TO THE LAST PAGE IN 

3963
02:46:39,289 --> 02:46:45,094
MY PAPER, IN THE VERY BOTTOM 

3964
02:46:42,992 --> 02:46:47,430
CORNER, THEY -- HERE IT IS.

3965
02:46:45,161 --> 02:46:48,031
THE RESULTS OF THE TREASURY 

3966
02:46:47,497 --> 02:46:49,866
AUCTION.

3967
02:46:48,098 --> 02:46:52,101
LITTLE TINY THING.

3968
02:46:49,933 --> 02:46:56,672
THEY SOLD FOUR -- THEY HAD 

3969
02:46:52,168 --> 02:46:58,241
APPLICATIONS ON THE FOUR WEEK 

3970
02:46:56,739 --> 02:46:59,108
TREASURY BILLS FOR A HUNDRED AND

3971
02:46:58,308 --> 02:47:02,612
SOME BILLION.

3972
02:46:59,175 --> 02:47:08,852
THEY ACCEPTED BIDS FOR 40 -- 43 

3973
02:47:02,678 --> 02:47:15,925
BILLION WORTH, AND IT SAYS 

3974
02:47:08,918 --> 02:47:16,225
AVERAGE -- AVERAGE PRICE, 

3975
02:47:15,992 --> 02:47:19,629
100.000000.

3976
02:47:16,292 --> 02:47:21,698
SIX ZEROS.

3977
02:47:19,696 --> 02:47:24,467
AND ESSENTIALLY, PEOPLE WERE 

3978
02:47:21,764 --> 02:47:27,070
GIVING 40-SOME BILLION TO THE 

3979
02:47:24,533 --> 02:47:28,071
TREASURY AND THEY OFFERED 30 

3980
02:47:27,137 --> 02:47:29,038
BILLION, WHATEVER THE AMOUNT 

3981
02:47:28,138 --> 02:47:32,942
WAS.

3982
02:47:29,105 --> 02:47:36,846
THE TREASURY RECEIVED THE MONEY 

3983
02:47:33,009 --> 02:47:38,514
AT ZERO AND JANET YELLEN HAS 

3984
02:47:36,912 --> 02:47:39,181
TALKED A COUPLE OF TIMES ABOUT 

3985
02:47:38,581 --> 02:47:41,284
THE REDUCED CARRYING COST OF THE

3986
02:47:39,248 --> 02:47:44,587
DEBT.

3987
02:47:41,351 --> 02:47:48,324
I THINK IN THE LAST FISCAL 

3988
02:47:44,654 --> 02:47:49,826
QUARTER, U.S. TREASURY, WHICH 

3989
02:47:48,391 --> 02:47:52,795
U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH HOLDS A 

3990
02:47:49,892 --> 02:47:54,263
FEW BILLION -- A FEW TRILLION 

3991
02:47:52,861 --> 02:47:56,666
DOLLARS THAN A YEAR AGO.

3992
02:47:54,330 --> 02:47:59,802
THE EXPENSE WAS DOWN 8%, SO YOU 

3993
02:47:56,732 --> 02:48:02,872
HAD THIS INCREDIBLE REDUCTION IN

3994
02:47:59,869 --> 02:48:05,908
THE SO-CALLED SUPER RISK-FREE 

3995
02:48:02,939 --> 02:48:08,411
GROUP, THE SHORT-TERM TREASURY 

3996
02:48:05,975 --> 02:48:10,313
BILL, AND THAT IS THE YARD STICK

3997
02:48:08,478 --> 02:48:10,580
AGAINST WHICH OTHER VALUES ARE 

3998
02:48:10,380 --> 02:48:15,718
MEASURED.

3999
02:48:10,647 --> 02:48:19,322
I MEAN, IF I COULD REDUCE 

4000
02:48:15,785 --> 02:48:22,658
GRAVITY, IGRAVITY'S PULL BY ABOT

4001
02:48:19,389 --> 02:48:24,727
80%, I'D BE IN THE TOKYO 

4002
02:48:22,725 --> 02:48:27,430
OLYMPICS JUMPING.

4003
02:48:24,794 --> 02:48:29,966
ESSENTIALLY IF INTEREST RATES 

4004
02:48:27,497 --> 02:48:31,968
WERE 10% VALUATIONS, THIS 

4005
02:48:30,032 --> 02:48:35,872
INCREDIBLE CHANGE IN THE 

4006
02:48:32,034 --> 02:48:39,108
VALUATION OF EVERYTHING THAT 

4007
02:48:35,938 --> 02:48:41,310
PRODUCES MONEY, BECAUSE THE RISK

4008
02:48:39,175 --> 02:48:41,543
FREE RATE PRODUCES REALLY SHORT 

4009
02:48:41,377 --> 02:48:43,079
ENOUGH.

4010
02:48:41,610 --> 02:48:44,113
RIGHT NOW, NOTHING.

4011
02:48:43,146 --> 02:48:48,184
VERY INTERESTING.

4012
02:48:44,180 --> 02:48:52,655
I BROUGHT THIS BOOK ALONG, 

4013
02:48:48,250 --> 02:48:56,392
BECAUSE FOR 25 OR MORE YEARS, 

4014
02:48:52,721 --> 02:48:57,627
PAUL SANDALSON'S BOOK WAS THE 

4015
02:48:56,459 --> 02:48:59,795
DEFINITIVE BOOK ON ECONOMICS.

4016
02:48:57,694 --> 02:49:02,231
IT'S TAUGHT IN EVERY SCHOOL.

4017
02:48:59,862 --> 02:49:07,103
AND PAUL WAS THE FIRST -- HE WAS

4018
02:49:02,298 --> 02:49:09,138
THE FIRST NOBEL PRIZE WINNER.

4019
02:49:07,170 --> 02:49:11,774
IT'S SORTS OF A COUSIN TO THE 

4020
02:49:09,204 --> 02:49:13,075
NOBEL PRICE.

4021
02:49:11,841 --> 02:49:15,411
THEY STARTED GIVING IT TO 

4022
02:49:13,142 --> 02:49:17,480
ECONOMICS IN THE EARLY 60s.

4023
02:49:15,478 --> 02:49:19,349
PAUL SAMUELSSON.

4024
02:49:17,547 --> 02:49:20,917
AMAZINGLY ENOUGH, THE SECOND 

4025
02:49:19,415 --> 02:49:25,021
WINNER THAT IS KEN ARROW AND 

4026
02:49:20,983 --> 02:49:26,322
BOTH OF THEM ARE THE UNCLES OF 

4027
02:49:25,088 --> 02:49:29,091
LARRY SOMERS.

4028
02:49:26,389 --> 02:49:31,093
HE HAS THE FIRST TWO AS UNCLES.

4029
02:49:29,158 --> 02:49:34,163
PAUL WAS A WONDERFUL GUY, A 

4030
02:49:31,160 --> 02:49:40,236
WONDERFUL WRITER, THE DEFINITIVE

4031
02:49:34,230 --> 02:49:43,172
WRITER, AND SO I GOT OUT TO '73 

4032
02:49:40,302 --> 02:49:45,241
ECONOMICS BOOK AND BEAR IN MIND 

4033
02:49:43,238 --> 02:49:46,742
ECONOMICS STARTED AS KIND OF AN 

4034
02:49:45,308 --> 02:49:49,145
INTERESTING SCIENCE.

4035
02:49:46,809 --> 02:49:51,847
ADAM SMITH WROTE THE WEALTH OF 

4036
02:49:49,212 --> 02:49:54,651
NATIONS IN 1776, SOME BOOKS, BUT

4037
02:49:51,914 --> 02:49:57,787
SORT OF DATE IT FROM KIND OF 

4038
02:49:54,717 --> 02:50:00,489
WHAT OUR COUNTRY STARTED AND YOU

4039
02:49:57,853 --> 02:50:02,791
HAVE ALL THESE GREAT ECONOMISTS.

4040
02:50:00,556 --> 02:50:04,727
I LOOKED UP IN THE BACK UNDER 

4041
02:50:02,858 --> 02:50:05,962
INTEREST RATES, I LOOKED FOR 

4042
02:50:04,793 --> 02:50:07,463
NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES.

4043
02:50:06,029 --> 02:50:12,201
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

4044
02:50:07,530 --> 02:50:15,104
SO I FINALLY FOUND ZERO INTEREST

4045
02:50:12,268 --> 02:50:17,607
RATES AND PAUL SAMUELSSON, 

4046
02:50:15,170 --> 02:50:19,642
BRILLIANT MAN, AFTER A COUPLE 

4047
02:50:17,674 --> 02:50:22,979
HUNDRED YEARS WE'VE HAD OF 

4048
02:50:19,708 --> 02:50:27,850
STUDYING ECONOMICS, BASICALLY, 

4049
02:50:23,046 --> 02:50:29,485
HE SAID THAT -- HE SAID YOU CAN 

4050
02:50:27,917 --> 02:50:31,587
CONCEIVABLY, TECHNICALLY, YOU 

4051
02:50:29,552 --> 02:50:34,023
CAN COP SIEVE PERHAPS OF 

4052
02:50:31,653 --> 02:50:36,459
NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES, BUT IT 

4053
02:50:34,090 --> 02:50:39,262
CAN'T EVER REALLY HAPPEN.

4054
02:50:36,526 --> 02:50:41,631
AND THAT WAS IN THE 1970s.

4055
02:50:39,329 --> 02:50:43,866
THIS WASN'T IN DARK AGES.

4056
02:50:41,698 --> 02:50:45,334
NO ECONOMIST ROLLED UP AND SAID 

4057
02:50:43,932 --> 02:50:47,637
THIS IS A TERRIBLE LINE.

4058
02:50:45,401 --> 02:50:49,672
AND HERE WE ARE IN THIS WORLD 

4059
02:50:47,703 --> 02:50:52,074
WHERE WE HAD ZERO INTEREST RATES

4060
02:50:49,739 --> 02:50:58,214
LAST YEAR -- I MEAN LAST WEEK --

4061
02:50:52,141 --> 02:50:59,982
OR THIS WEEK OUT OF FOUR WEEK 

4062
02:50:58,281 --> 02:51:01,517
NOTE, AND BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY 

4063
02:51:00,049 --> 02:51:03,786
WHICH HAS MORE THAN THIS BUT 

4064
02:51:01,583 --> 02:51:05,721
LET'S SAY WE HAD A HUNDRED 

4065
02:51:03,853 --> 02:51:07,857
BILLION IN TREASURY BILLS.

4066
02:51:05,788 --> 02:51:10,760
WE HAVE MORE THAN THAT.

4067
02:51:07,924 --> 02:51:12,495
BEFORE THE EPIDEMIC -- PANDEMIC,

4068
02:51:10,827 --> 02:51:15,464
WE WERE GETTING ABOUT A BILLION 

4069
02:51:12,561 --> 02:51:18,067
AND A HALF FROM THAT A YEAR.

4070
02:51:15,531 --> 02:51:21,771
AT PRESENT RATES, IF IT'S TWO 

4071
02:51:18,134 --> 02:51:22,471
BASIS POINTS, WE'D GET 20 

4072
02:51:21,838 --> 02:51:24,774
MILLION.

4073
02:51:22,538 --> 02:51:29,211
IMAGINE YOUR WAGES GOING FROM 

4074
02:51:24,841 --> 02:51:31,714
$15 TO $1.20 AN HOUR.

4075
02:51:29,278 --> 02:51:33,416
IT'S BEEN A SEA CHANGE.

4076
02:51:31,781 --> 02:51:35,084
IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE THAT.

4077
02:51:33,483 --> 02:51:35,584
THAT'S WHY THE FED MOVED THE WAY

4078
02:51:35,151 --> 02:51:39,555
THEY DID.

4079
02:51:35,651 --> 02:51:43,359
THEY WANTED TO GIVE A MASSIVE 

4080
02:51:39,622 --> 02:51:43,626
PUSH LIKE MARIO DRAGGY DID IN 

4081
02:51:43,426 --> 02:51:45,761
EUROPE.

4082
02:51:43,693 --> 02:51:49,131
HE SPED WHATEVER IT TAKES AND 

4083
02:51:45,828 --> 02:51:51,734
THEY WENT TO NEGATIVE RATES, AND

4084
02:51:49,198 --> 02:51:56,872
WE -- FAIR TOO SAY DIDN'T WANT 

4085
02:51:51,800 --> 02:51:59,475
TO GO TO NEGATIVE RATES.

4086
02:51:56,939 --> 02:52:01,477
BUT IF PRESENT RATES WERE 

4087
02:51:59,541 --> 02:52:03,179
DESTINED TO BE APPROPRIATE, 

4088
02:52:01,544 --> 02:52:07,850
TEN-YEAR SHOULD REALLY BE AT THE

4089
02:52:03,246 --> 02:52:10,753
PRICE IT IS, THOSE COMPANIES 

4090
02:52:07,916 --> 02:52:12,054
THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THIS 

4091
02:52:10,820 --> 02:52:15,257
QUESTION, THEY'RE -- THEY HAVE 

4092
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:18,327
THE ABILITY TO DELIVER CASH AT A

4093
02:52:15,324 --> 02:52:21,564
RATE THAT'S IF YOU DISCOUNT IT 

4094
02:52:18,394 --> 02:52:22,198
BACK AND YOU'RE DISCOUNTING AT 

4095
02:52:21,631 --> 02:52:23,432
PRESENT INTEREST RATES, STOCKS 

4096
02:52:22,265 --> 02:52:25,501
ARE VERY, VERY CHEAP.

4097
02:52:23,499 --> 02:52:27,036
NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT 

4098
02:52:25,568 --> 02:52:28,871
INTEREST RATES DO OVER TIME.

4099
02:52:27,103 --> 02:52:31,207
BUT THERE'S A VIEW OF WHAT THE 

4100
02:52:28,937 --> 02:52:33,576
RATES WILL BE BASED ON YIELD OUT

4101
02:52:31,274 --> 02:52:36,212
30 YEARS AND SO ON.

4102
02:52:33,643 --> 02:52:38,247
IT'S A FASCINATING TIME.

4103
02:52:36,279 --> 02:52:40,149
WE'VE NEVER REALLY SEEN WHAT 

4104
02:52:38,313 --> 02:52:44,787
SHOVELING MONEY IN ON THE BASIS 

4105
02:52:40,216 --> 02:52:46,922
THAT WE'RE DOING IT ON A FISCAL 

4106
02:52:44,853 --> 02:52:49,792
BASIS WHILE FOLLOWING A MONETARY

4107
02:52:46,989 --> 02:52:51,761
POLICY IN THE CLOSE ZERO 

4108
02:52:49,858 --> 02:52:52,495
INTEREST RATES AND IT IS 

4109
02:52:51,828 --> 02:52:54,764
ENORMOUSLY PLEASANT.

4110
02:52:52,562 --> 02:52:55,398
BUT IN ECONOMICS THERE'S ONE 

4111
02:52:54,831 --> 02:52:56,999
THING ALWAYS.

4112
02:52:55,465 --> 02:52:59,502
YOU CAN NEVER DO ONE THING.

4113
02:52:57,066 --> 02:52:59,702
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO SAY AND THEN 

4114
02:52:59,569 --> 02:53:08,911
WHAT.

4115
02:52:59,769 --> 02:53:13,082
AND WE'RE SENDING OUT HUGE SUMS,

4116
02:53:08,978 --> 02:53:15,351
I MEAN, PRESIDENT SEND ON 85% 

4117
02:53:13,148 --> 02:53:17,553
ARE GOING TO GET A CHECK.

4118
02:53:15,418 --> 02:53:20,022
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE WERE 

4119
02:53:17,620 --> 02:53:22,558
SAYING 40% COULD NEVER COME UP 

4120
02:53:20,089 --> 02:53:24,727
WITH $400 OF CASH.

4121
02:53:22,625 --> 02:53:27,897
WE'VE GOT 85% OF THE PEOPLE 

4122
02:53:24,793 --> 02:53:28,831
GETTING THOSE SUMS AND SO FAR 

4123
02:53:27,964 --> 02:53:29,932
WE'VE HAD NO PLEASANT 

4124
02:53:28,898 --> 02:53:33,736
CONSEQUENCES ABOUT IT.

4125
02:53:29,999 --> 02:53:37,507
PEOPLE WHO GET THE MONEY FEEL 

4126
02:53:33,803 --> 02:53:39,742
BETTER AND PEOPLE WHO ARE 

4127
02:53:37,573 --> 02:53:42,111
LENDING MONEY DOESN'T.

4128
02:53:39,809 --> 02:53:44,046
IT CAUSES AN ELECTRIC TO BE 

4129
02:53:42,177 --> 02:53:45,214
HAPPY AND WE'LL SEE IF IT CAUSES

4130
02:53:44,113 --> 02:53:47,283
ANYTHING ELSE.

4131
02:53:45,281 --> 02:53:48,718
AND IF IT DOESN'T CAUSE ANYTHING

4132
02:53:47,350 --> 02:53:51,153
ELSE, YOU CAN COUNT ON IT 

4133
02:53:48,784 --> 02:53:52,588
CONTINUING IN A VERY BIG WAY.

4134
02:53:51,220 --> 02:53:55,624
BUT THERE ARE CONSEQENCES TO 

4135
02:53:52,654 --> 02:53:59,762
EVERYTHING IN ECONOMICS.

4136
02:53:55,691 --> 02:54:02,231
THAT IS -- THAT IS WHY THE 

4137
02:53:59,829 --> 02:54:04,300
APPLES WHEN WE OPEN MICROSOFT, 

4138
02:54:02,297 --> 02:54:06,135
BUT THEY ARE INCREDIBLE 

4139
02:54:04,367 --> 02:54:06,368
COMPANIES IN WHAT THEY EARN ON 

4140
02:54:06,202 --> 02:54:08,337
CAPITAL.

4141
02:54:06,435 --> 02:54:11,006
THEY DON'T REQUIRE A LOT OF 

4142
02:54:08,404 --> 02:54:13,909
CAPITAL AND THEY GUSH OUT MORE 

4143
02:54:11,073 --> 02:54:16,111
MONEY, AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO 

4144
02:54:13,976 --> 02:54:17,780
POINT BONDS THAT GUSH OUT MORE 

4145
02:54:16,178 --> 02:54:20,749
MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL 

4146
02:54:17,847 --> 02:54:21,016
GOVERNMENT, WE GOT A HUNDRED 

4147
02:54:20,816 --> 02:54:23,486
BILLION.

4148
02:54:21,083 --> 02:54:26,489
LIKE 30 OR $40 MILLION A YEAR, 

4149
02:54:23,553 --> 02:54:28,257
WHATEVER IT MAY BE, DEPENDING ON

4150
02:54:26,556 --> 02:54:30,793
THE SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATE.

4151
02:54:28,324 --> 02:54:32,261
WHICH PUT THE PRESSURE ON, WHICH

4152
02:54:30,860 --> 02:54:32,561
IS EXACTLY WHAT THE AUTHORITIES 

4153
02:54:32,328 --> 02:54:34,530
WANT.

4154
02:54:32,628 --> 02:54:36,299
I MEAN, THAT'S -- THEY ARE 

4155
02:54:34,597 --> 02:54:38,334
PUSHING THE ECONOMY IN A -- AND 

4156
02:54:36,365 --> 02:54:40,636
THEY'RE DOING IT IN EUROPE, EVEN

4157
02:54:38,401 --> 02:54:44,306
MORE EXTREME, AND THEY'RE 

4158
02:54:40,702 --> 02:54:46,742
PUSHING IT AND WE'RE AIDING IT 

4159
02:54:44,373 --> 02:54:48,410
WITH FISCAL POLICY.

4160
02:54:46,809 --> 02:54:49,512
PEOPLE HAVE BECOME NUMB TO 

4161
02:54:48,477 --> 02:54:53,682
NUMBERS.

4162
02:54:49,579 --> 02:54:54,283
TRILLIONS DON'T MEAN ANYTHING TO

4163
02:54:53,749 --> 02:54:56,919
ANYBODY.

4164
02:54:54,350 --> 02:54:57,219
AND $1400 DOES MEAN SOMETHING TO

4165
02:54:56,986 --> 02:54:59,155
THEM.

4166
02:54:57,286 --> 02:55:01,390
WE'LL SEE WHERE IT ALL LEADS, 

4167
02:54:59,221 --> 02:55:03,492
BUT CHARLIE AND I CONSIDER THE 

4168
02:55:01,456 --> 02:55:05,694
MOST INTERESTING MOVIE BY FAR 

4169
02:55:03,559 --> 02:55:06,061
WE'VE EVER SEEN IN TERMS OF 

4170
02:55:05,761 --> 02:55:09,198
ECONOMICS.

4171
02:55:06,128 --> 02:55:10,900
>> YES, AND THE PROFESSIONAL 

4172
02:55:09,265 --> 02:55:11,700
ECONOMISTS ARE VERY SURPRISED BY

4173
02:55:10,967 --> 02:55:14,670
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

4174
02:55:11,767 --> 02:55:14,870
IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT CHURCHILL 

4175
02:55:14,737 --> 02:55:17,807
SAID.

4176
02:55:14,937 --> 02:55:20,576
HE SAID HE WAS A MODEST MAN AND 

4177
02:55:17,873 --> 02:55:22,011
A GREAT DEAL MODEST ABOUT AND 

4178
02:55:20,643 --> 02:55:24,680
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING 

4179
02:55:22,077 --> 02:55:26,549
WITH THE ECONOMISTS.

4180
02:55:24,747 --> 02:55:29,952
THEY'RE SO COMMON ON EVERYTHING

4181
02:55:26,616 --> 02:55:33,088
TURNS OUT THE WORLD IS MORE 

4182
02:55:30,018 --> 02:55:35,891
COMPLICATED THAN THEY THOUGHT.

4183
02:55:33,155 --> 02:55:39,127
>> AS A FOLLOW-UP TO THAT, 

4184
02:55:35,957 --> 02:55:42,131
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ABOUT THE 

4185
02:55:39,194 --> 02:55:44,533
ECONOMIC THEORY MMT, ESPECIALLY 

4186
02:55:42,198 --> 02:55:46,735
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE IT'S 

4187
02:55:44,600 --> 02:55:50,172
THE RESERVE KURPSY OF THE WORLD.

4188
02:55:46,802 --> 02:55:52,008
>> I THINK THE MONETARY THEY'RE 

4189
02:55:50,238 --> 02:55:53,309
LISTS ARE MORE CONFIDENT THAN 

4190
02:55:52,074 --> 02:55:54,843
THEY NEED TO BE.

4191
02:55:53,376 --> 02:55:56,078
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY OF US KNOW

4192
02:55:54,910 --> 02:55:58,213
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

4193
02:55:56,145 --> 02:56:00,449
I DO THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

4194
02:55:58,280 --> 02:56:03,118
THAT THERE'S EXTREME CONDUCT IS 

4195
02:56:00,515 --> 02:56:03,351
MORE FEASIBLE THAN EVERYBODY 

4196
02:56:03,185 --> 02:56:05,154
THOUGHT.

4197
02:56:03,418 --> 02:56:09,125
I KNOW IF YOU KEEP DOING IT 

4198
02:56:05,221 --> 02:56:10,426
WITHOUT ANY LIMIT, IT WILL END 

4199
02:56:09,191 --> 02:56:13,362
IN DISASTER.

4200
02:56:10,493 --> 02:56:17,833
>> UNRELATED QUESTION, AL CANDLE

4201
02:56:13,429 --> 02:56:20,135
WROTE IN ON THIS TOO AND SAID IF

4202
02:56:17,900 --> 02:56:22,871
YOU CAN BORROW MONEY FOR A LOW 

4203
02:56:20,202 --> 02:56:23,739
INTEREST RATE, IS IT STILL WORTH

4204
02:56:22,938 --> 02:56:27,276
BORROWING THAT MONEY?

4205
02:56:23,806 --> 02:56:31,113
>> IT REDUCES THE VALUE BY A 

4206
02:56:27,343 --> 02:56:33,115
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT, AND WE HAVE 

4207
02:56:31,180 --> 02:56:34,183
THE FLEXIBILITY THAT VIRTUALLY 

4208
02:56:33,182 --> 02:56:36,585
NO ONE HAS.

4209
02:56:34,250 --> 02:56:42,692
I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS IN THE 

4210
02:56:36,651 --> 02:56:45,828
ANNUAL LETTER, BUT THE -- THE 

4211
02:56:42,758 --> 02:56:46,595
VALUE HAS GONE DOWN 

4212
02:56:45,895 --> 02:56:48,163
DRAMATICALLY, BECAUSE EVERYTHING

4213
02:56:46,662 --> 02:56:50,833
IS -- EVERYTHING IS OFF OF 

4214
02:56:48,230 --> 02:56:55,337
INTEREST RATES,S AND WHEN YOU 

4215
02:56:50,900 --> 02:56:57,339
GET TO NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES, 

4216
02:56:55,404 --> 02:57:00,109
THE COUNTRY CAN BORROW NEGATIVE 

4217
02:56:57,405 --> 02:57:02,344
INTEREST RATES, YOU GET 

4218
02:57:00,175 --> 02:57:03,078
SOMETHING ABOUT THE ST. 

4219
02:57:02,411 --> 02:57:05,948
PETERSBURG PARADOX.

4220
02:57:03,145 --> 02:57:08,283
THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO GO TO 

4221
02:57:06,015 --> 02:57:11,520
CHURCH.

4222
02:57:08,350 --> 02:57:12,921
IT'S A CRAZY GLIMPSE OF A BUNCH 

4223
02:57:11,587 --> 02:57:17,959
OF ABSTRACT MATHEMATICS FOR YOU 

4224
02:57:12,988 --> 02:57:19,394
TO GET THERE, BUT YOU'LL LOSE 

4225
02:57:18,026 --> 02:57:23,332
GRAVITY ENTIRELY AND YOU KNOW, 

4226
02:57:19,461 --> 02:57:24,833
IF YOU TELL ME THAT THAT I'M 

4227
02:57:23,399 --> 02:57:26,802
GOING TO HAVE TO LEND MONEY FOR 

4228
02:57:24,900 --> 02:57:28,470
THE GOVERNMENT AT MINUS 2% A 

4229
02:57:26,869 --> 02:57:31,006
YEAR AND I'M TALKING PHENOMENAL 

4230
02:57:28,537 --> 02:57:32,975
FIGURES, NOT -- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE

4231
02:57:31,073 --> 02:57:33,442
TALKING HOW I'LL GO BROKE OVER 

4232
02:57:33,042 --> 02:57:35,778
TIME.

4233
02:57:33,509 --> 02:57:38,847
IF I DO THAT.

4234
02:57:35,845 --> 02:57:40,215
SO IT PUSHES YOU TO DO OTHER 

4235
02:57:38,914 --> 02:57:40,382
THINGS, AND OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN

4236
02:57:40,282 --> 02:57:42,518
IT.

4237
02:57:40,448 --> 02:57:46,889
WE SAW THE ROAST OF THE WORLD DO

4238
02:57:42,585 --> 02:57:49,825
IT IN MORE EXTREME FASHION, BUT 

4239
02:57:46,956 --> 02:57:50,059
NOBODY, SAMUELSSON, BRILLIANT 

4240
02:57:49,892 --> 02:57:51,393
MAN.

4241
02:57:50,126 --> 02:57:51,660
NOBODY THOUGHT YOU COULD DO 

4242
02:57:51,460 --> 02:57:53,529
THIS.

4243
02:57:51,727 --> 02:57:55,331
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE 

4244
02:57:53,595 --> 02:57:57,399
CONSEQUENCES ARE BUT WE KNOW 

4245
02:57:55,397 --> 02:57:57,800
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES 

4246
02:57:57,466 --> 02:58:00,002
OBVIOUSLY.

4247
02:57:57,867 --> 02:58:02,371
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM SAM 

4248
02:58:00,069 --> 02:58:04,039
BUTLER AND IT SAYS HE'S BEEN A 

4249
02:58:02,437 --> 02:58:06,108
SHAREHOLDER FOR MANY YEARS AND 

4250
02:58:04,105 --> 02:58:10,713
ASKS WHAT DOES THE IMPACT OF THE

4251
02:58:06,175 --> 02:58:13,148
LIVES OF SO MANY NEW SPACS TO 

4252
02:58:10,780 --> 02:58:15,818
FIND AND CLOSE NEW OPPOSITIONS. 

4253
02:58:13,215 --> 02:58:18,354
>> WELL, IT'S A KILLER.

4254
02:58:15,885 --> 02:58:20,956
THE SPACS GENERALLY HAVE TO 

4255
02:58:18,420 --> 02:58:21,890
SPEND THEIR MONEY IN TWO YEARS, 

4256
02:58:21,023 --> 02:58:23,625
AS I UNDERSTAND IT.

4257
02:58:21,957 --> 02:58:26,428
IF YOU HAVE TO BUY A BUSINESS IN

4258
02:58:23,692 --> 02:58:28,564
TWO YEARS, YOU PUT A GUN TO MY 

4259
02:58:26,495 --> 02:58:30,733
HEAD AND SAID YOU GOT TO BUY A 

4260
02:58:28,631 --> 02:58:32,401
BUSINESS IN TWO YEARS, I'D BUY 

4261
02:58:30,799 --> 02:58:32,701
ONE BUT IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH OF 

4262
02:58:32,468 --> 02:58:35,471
ONE.

4263
02:58:32,768 --> 02:58:37,339
WE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND NOW 

4264
02:58:35,537 --> 02:58:37,740
THERE ARE -- I DON'T KNOW HOW 

4265
02:58:37,406 --> 02:58:38,841
MANY.

4266
02:58:37,807 --> 02:58:40,509
THERE'S HUNDREDS -- THERE'S 

4267
02:58:38,908 --> 02:58:41,509
ALWAYS BEEN THE PRESSURE FROM 

4268
02:58:40,575 --> 02:58:43,779
PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS.

4269
02:58:41,576 --> 02:58:45,013
IF YOU'RE RUNNING MONEY FOR 

4270
02:58:43,845 --> 02:58:47,015
SOMEBODY ELSE AND YOU GET A FEE 

4271
02:58:45,080 --> 02:58:49,317
AND YOU GET THE UP SIDE AND YOU 

4272
02:58:47,082 --> 02:58:51,653
DON'T HAVE THE DOWN SIDE, YOU 

4273
02:58:49,384 --> 02:58:54,623
GOT TO BUY SOMETHING.

4274
02:58:51,720 --> 02:58:57,226
I COULD TELL YOU, BUT I HAD A 

4275
02:58:54,689 --> 02:58:59,294
VERY FAMOUS -- I HAD A CALL FROM

4276
02:58:57,293 --> 02:59:01,997
A VERY FAMOUS FIGURE MANY YEARS 

4277
02:58:59,361 --> 02:59:03,632
AGO THAT WAS INVOLVED IN AND 

4278
02:59:02,063 --> 02:59:04,733
WONDERED ABOUT REINSURANCE.

4279
02:59:03,699 --> 02:59:07,302
I SAID I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY

4280
02:59:04,799 --> 02:59:10,272
GOOD BUSINESS.

4281
02:59:07,369 --> 02:59:12,208
HE SAID, YEAH, THE MONEY IN SIX 

4282
02:59:10,339 --> 02:59:13,375
MONTHS AND I HAVE TO GIVE IT 

4283
02:59:12,274 --> 02:59:15,877
BACK TO THE VERSE.

4284
02:59:13,442 --> 02:59:17,612
IT'S A DIFFERENT EQUATION WHERE 

4285
02:59:15,944 --> 02:59:20,115
YOU WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S 

4286
02:59:17,679 --> 02:59:22,618
MONEY WHERE YOU GET THE UP SIDE 

4287
02:59:20,182 --> 02:59:24,920
AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT BACK TO 

4288
02:59:22,685 --> 02:59:25,921
THEM IF NOTHING -- THAT WILL GO 

4289
02:59:24,987 --> 02:59:27,990
ON FOREVER.

4290
02:59:25,988 --> 02:59:29,424
IT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS NOW AND 

4291
02:59:28,056 --> 02:59:31,660
WALL STREET GOES WHERE THE MONEY

4292
02:59:29,491 --> 02:59:34,163
IS AND IT DOES ANYTHING, 

4293
02:59:31,727 --> 02:59:35,965
BASICALLY, THAT -- THE WORKS, 

4294
02:59:34,230 --> 02:59:39,735
AND SPACS HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR 

4295
02:59:36,031 --> 02:59:41,770
A WHILE AND YOU SEEK STICK A 

4296
02:59:39,802 --> 02:59:44,173
FAMOUS NAME ON IT, YOU CAN SELL 

4297
02:59:41,836 --> 02:59:46,609
ALMOST ANYTHING, AND I GUESS -- 

4298
02:59:44,240 --> 02:59:53,682
ICE AN EXAGGERATED VERSION OF 

4299
02:59:46,675 --> 02:59:56,852
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN KIND OF -- 

4300
02:59:53,749 --> 03:00:00,956
WELL, GAMBLING DONE TYPE MARKET.

4301
02:59:56,919 --> 03:00:02,858
I DID HAVE A COLT FROM KANES 

4302
03:00:01,022 --> 03:00:06,962
THAT WE MIGHT PUT UP ON THE -- 

4303
03:00:02,925 --> 03:00:08,898
LET'S SEE IF I'VE GOT -- YEAH.

4304
03:00:07,029 --> 03:00:11,066
THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST -- ONE

4305
03:00:08,964 --> 03:00:11,333
OF THE MOST FAMOUS QUOTES IN 

4306
03:00:11,133 --> 03:00:12,668
HISTORY.

4307
03:00:11,400 --> 03:00:15,470
BECAUSE IT REALLY SUMS UP THE 

4308
03:00:12,735 --> 03:00:16,205
PROBLEM OF THE FACT WE'VE GOT 

4309
03:00:15,537 --> 03:00:17,873
THE GREATEST MARKETS THE WORLD 

4310
03:00:16,272 --> 03:00:18,874
COULD EVER IMAGINE.

4311
03:00:17,940 --> 03:00:20,542
IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO OWN PARTS 

4312
03:00:18,941 --> 03:00:22,678
OF THE BIGGEST BUSINESSES IN THE

4313
03:00:20,609 --> 03:00:24,379
WORLD AND PUTTING BILLIONS OF 

4314
03:00:22,744 --> 03:00:26,148
DOLLARS AND TAKE IT OUT, YOU 

4315
03:00:24,446 --> 03:00:28,550
KNOW, TWO DAYS LATER.

4316
03:00:26,215 --> 03:00:30,352
I MEAN, COMPARED TO FARMS OR 

4317
03:00:28,616 --> 03:00:31,287
APARTMENT HOUSES OR OFFICE 

4318
03:00:30,419 --> 03:00:33,989
BUILDINGS WHERE IT TAKES MONTHS 

4319
03:00:31,353 --> 03:00:35,891
TO CLOSE A DEAL, THE MARKETS OFF

4320
03:00:34,056 --> 03:00:39,394
A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN 

4321
03:00:35,957 --> 03:00:42,564
INVEST -- IN EARNING ASSETS ON A

4322
03:00:39,461 --> 03:00:43,732
BASIS THAT'S VERY, VERY LOW 

4323
03:00:42,631 --> 03:00:44,900
COST.

4324
03:00:43,799 --> 03:00:46,768
INSTANTANEOUS, HUGE, ALL KINDS 

4325
03:00:44,967 --> 03:00:48,370
OF GOOD THINGS.

4326
03:00:46,835 --> 03:00:51,874
IT MAKES IT REAL MONEY IF THEY 

4327
03:00:48,437 --> 03:00:55,777
CAN GET THE GAMBLERS TO COME IN.

4328
03:00:51,941 --> 03:00:56,278
THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE MORE 

4329
03:00:55,844 --> 03:01:00,849
ACTION.

4330
03:00:56,345 --> 03:01:03,686
YOU HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE, HUGE 

4331
03:01:00,916 --> 03:01:05,554
ASSET TO HUMANITY BUT IT REALLY 

4332
03:01:03,752 --> 03:01:06,622
MAKES US MONEY WHEN PEOPLE ARE 

4333
03:01:05,620 --> 03:01:08,924
DOING STUPID THINGS.

4334
03:01:06,689 --> 03:01:09,157
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY REALLY 

4335
03:01:08,991 --> 03:01:12,194
IS.

4336
03:01:09,224 --> 03:01:14,563
GAINES WROTE THIS IN 1936.

4337
03:01:12,261 --> 03:01:19,368
IT SAYS IS 39 ON THE SLIDE BUT 

4338
03:01:14,629 --> 03:01:21,637
HE WROTE IT IN 1936.

4339
03:01:19,435 --> 03:01:23,572
SPECULATORS, MANY DO NO HARM AS 

4340
03:01:21,704 --> 03:01:26,107
BUBBLES ON THE STEADY STREAM OF 

4341
03:01:23,638 --> 03:01:28,510
ENTERPRISE BUT THE POSITION IS 

4342
03:01:26,174 --> 03:01:29,912
SERIOUS WHEN ENTERPRISE BECOMES 

4343
03:01:28,576 --> 03:01:31,346
THE BUBBLE ON SPECULATION.

4344
03:01:29,979 --> 03:01:32,514
WHEN THE CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT OF 

4345
03:01:31,413 --> 03:01:35,717
THE COUNTRY BECOMES A BYPRODUCT 

4346
03:01:32,580 --> 03:01:40,322
OF THE TIFS OF A CASINO, THE JOB

4347
03:01:35,784 --> 03:01:42,658
IS LIKELY TO BE ILL DONE.

4348
03:01:40,389 --> 03:01:44,359
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE

4349
03:01:42,725 --> 03:01:46,428
CASINO, THE LAST YEAR.

4350
03:01:44,426 --> 03:01:48,063
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 

4351
03:01:46,494 --> 03:01:51,233
HAVE SET UP ACCOUNTS WHERE 

4352
03:01:48,129 --> 03:01:52,935
THEY'RE DAY TRADING, PUTS AND 

4353
03:01:51,300 --> 03:01:54,903
CALLS, AND I'D SAY YOU HAVE THE 

4354
03:01:53,002 --> 03:01:56,739
GREATEST INCREASE IN THE NUMBER 

4355
03:01:54,970 --> 03:01:58,741
OF GAMBLERS, ESSENTIALLY, 

4356
03:01:56,805 --> 03:02:00,876
THAT -- AND THERE'S NOTHING 

4357
03:01:58,807 --> 03:02:02,711
WRONG WITH GAMBLING.

4358
03:02:00,943 --> 03:02:04,980
THEY GOT BETTER ODDS THAN THEY 

4359
03:02:02,778 --> 03:02:06,648
PLAY THE STATE LOTTERY, BUT 

4360
03:02:05,047 --> 03:02:06,949
THEY'VE HAD CASH IN THEIR 

4361
03:02:06,715 --> 03:02:08,583
POCKET.

4362
03:02:07,016 --> 03:02:10,419
THEY'VE HAD ACTION, AND THEY 

4363
03:02:08,650 --> 03:02:13,756
ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF GOOD 

4364
03:02:10,485 --> 03:02:15,958
RESULTS AND IF THEY JUST BOUGHT 

4365
03:02:13,822 --> 03:02:19,461
STOCKS THEY'D DO FINE, AND HELD 

4366
03:02:16,025 --> 03:02:21,029
THEM, BUT THE GAMBLING IMPULSES 

4367
03:02:19,527 --> 03:02:22,664
IN VERY STRONG IN PEOPLE 

4368
03:02:21,096 --> 03:02:25,567
WORLDWIDE AND OCCASIONALLY IT 

4369
03:02:22,731 --> 03:02:30,305
GETS AN ENORMOUS SHOVE AND 

4370
03:02:25,633 --> 03:02:32,374
CONDITIONS LEAD TO THIS WHERE 

4371
03:02:30,372 --> 03:02:33,976
MORE PEOPLE ARE BUYING.

4372
03:02:32,441 --> 03:02:36,945
THEY'RE LEAVING EVERY DAY AND 

4373
03:02:34,042 --> 03:02:38,847
THAT CREATES ITS OWN RAEMT FOR A

4374
03:02:37,012 --> 03:02:43,252
WHILE AND NOBODY TELLS YOU WHEN 

4375
03:02:38,914 --> 03:02:47,889
THE CLOCK IS GOING TO STRIKE 

4376
03:02:43,318 --> 03:02:48,657
MIDNIGHT AND IT ALL TURNS INTO 

4377
03:02:47,956 --> 03:02:50,659
PUMPKINS.

4378
03:02:48,724 --> 03:02:52,995
WHEN THE COMPETITION IS PLAYING 

4379
03:02:50,725 --> 03:02:53,962
WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY OR 

4380
03:02:53,061 --> 03:02:57,866
WHETHER THEY'RE -- AND IF 

4381
03:02:54,028 --> 03:02:58,567
THEY'RE PLAYING TOOLISHLY WITH 

4382
03:02:57,933 --> 03:03:00,402
THEIR OWN MONEY BUT THE BIG 

4383
03:02:58,633 --> 03:03:01,169
STUFF IS DONE WITH OTHER 

4384
03:03:00,469 --> 03:03:03,205
PEOPLE'S MONEY.

4385
03:03:01,236 --> 03:03:05,040
THEY'RE GOING TO BEAT US.

4386
03:03:03,272 --> 03:03:06,508
WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE NOT -- THAT'S

4387
03:03:05,106 --> 03:03:08,076
A DIFFERENT GAME AND THEY'VE 

4388
03:03:06,574 --> 03:03:09,878
GOT -- THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF 

4389
03:03:08,143 --> 03:03:12,914
MONEY, SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO 

4390
03:03:09,945 --> 03:03:16,351
HAVE MUCH LUCK ON ACQUISITIONS 

4391
03:03:12,981 --> 03:03:17,886
WHILE IS THIS SORT OF A PERIOD 

4392
03:03:16,418 --> 03:03:18,186
CONTINUES, BUT IT'S HAPPENED 

4393
03:03:17,953 --> 03:03:20,955
BEFORE.

4394
03:03:18,253 --> 03:03:27,829
THIS IS ABOUT AS EXTREME AS 

4395
03:03:21,022 --> 03:03:28,062
WE'VE SEEN ITS, HASN'T, CHARLIE?

4396
03:03:28,129 --> 03:03:31,533
I CALL IT FEE DEVELOPMENT.

4397
03:03:29,665 --> 03:03:34,069
THE ADVISOR GETS A FEE, AND OF 

4398
03:03:31,600 --> 03:03:36,671
COURSE, THE MORE THAT YOU GET, 

4399
03:03:34,135 --> 03:03:38,406
THE SILLIER YOUR CIVILIZATION IS

4400
03:03:36,738 --> 03:03:41,276
GETTING, AND TO SOME EXTENT IT'S

4401
03:03:38,473 --> 03:03:43,211
A MORAL FAILING, TOO.

4402
03:03:41,343 --> 03:03:47,382
BECAUSE THE EASY MONEY MADE BY 

4403
03:03:43,278 --> 03:03:49,317
THINGS LIKE SPACS AND RETURN 

4404
03:03:47,448 --> 03:03:52,888
DERIVATIVES AND SO ON AND SO ON.

4405
03:03:49,384 --> 03:03:54,456
YOU PUSH THAT TO EXCESS, IT 

4406
03:03:52,954 --> 03:03:55,691
CAUSES HORRIBLE PROBLEMS IN 

4407
03:03:54,523 --> 03:03:57,025
CIVILIZATION AND REFLECTS NO 

4408
03:03:55,757 --> 03:03:59,628
CREDIT ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 

4409
03:03:57,092 --> 03:04:01,463
DOING IT AND NO CREDIT ON THE 

4410
03:03:59,694 --> 03:04:04,199
PEOPLE -- THE REGULATORS.

4411
03:04:01,530 --> 03:04:05,634
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT TO BE 

4412
03:04:04,266 --> 03:04:06,068
ASHIEMD OF IN CURRENT 

4413
03:04:05,701 --> 03:04:07,736
CONDITIONS.

4414
03:04:06,135 --> 03:04:10,372
BUT IT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS.

4415
03:04:07,803 --> 03:04:12,340
IT'S SHAMEFUL WHAT'S GOING ON.

4416
03:04:10,439 --> 03:04:14,443
IT'S NOT JUST STUPID, IT'S 

4417
03:04:12,407 --> 03:04:17,045
SHAMEFUL.

4418
03:04:14,510 --> 03:04:18,981
IT'S NOT -- I DON'T REGARD IT AS

4419
03:04:17,112 --> 03:04:21,950
A SHAMEFUL ON A LOT -- THE 

4420
03:04:19,047 --> 03:04:25,353
PEOPLE THAT GAMBLE.

4421
03:04:22,017 --> 03:04:26,321
I MEAN -- GAMBLING IS A HUMAN 

4422
03:04:25,420 --> 03:04:28,557
INSTINCT AND THEY'VE GOT MONEY 

4423
03:04:26,388 --> 03:04:32,027
IN THEIR POCKET AND THEY KNOW 

4424
03:04:28,623 --> 03:04:33,996
SOMEBODY ELSE THAT'S MADE MONEY 

4425
03:04:32,094 --> 03:04:35,163
THAT THEY DON'T THINK ARE 

4426
03:04:34,062 --> 03:04:36,198
SMARTER THAN THEM.

4427
03:04:35,230 --> 03:04:38,967
I DON'T LIKE THE PROFESSIONALS 

4428
03:04:36,265 --> 03:04:40,335
THAT TAKE THE SUCKERS.

4429
03:04:39,034 --> 03:04:42,404
>> ALL RIGHT.

4430
03:04:40,402 --> 03:04:44,573
MOSHE LAVINE WRITES IN -- HE'S 

4431
03:04:42,470 --> 03:04:47,676
AN AMERICAN LIVING IN ISRAEL.

4432
03:04:44,640 --> 03:04:50,045
HE SAID IF YOU DEEM STOCK PRICES

4433
03:04:47,743 --> 03:04:51,747
TO BE OVERVALUED DO YOU THINK 

4434
03:04:50,111 --> 03:04:53,582
I'S BETTER TO HOLD IN CASH OR 

4435
03:04:51,813 --> 03:04:55,317
WOULD IT BE A BETTER IDEA TO 

4436
03:04:53,648 --> 03:04:58,153
INVEST THIS MONEY IN SOME WAY 

4437
03:04:55,384 --> 03:04:59,321
WHILE WAITING FOR STOCK PRICES 

4438
03:04:58,220 --> 03:05:01,556
ARE FAIR AGAIN AND SELL THE 

4439
03:04:59,388 --> 03:05:03,191
INVESTMENT TO BUY THE STOCKS.

4440
03:05:01,623 --> 03:05:05,093
>> CHARLIE AND I HAVE HAD THAT 

4441
03:05:03,257 --> 03:05:07,129
DISCUSSION ON A LOT OF THINGS.

4442
03:05:05,160 --> 03:05:09,364
WE BOUGHT SOME STOCKS WE REALLY 

4443
03:05:07,196 --> 03:05:13,235
DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT BUT 

4444
03:05:09,431 --> 03:05:14,102
I'M NOT REALLY COMFORTABLE DOING

4445
03:05:13,302 --> 03:05:17,172
THAT.

4446
03:05:14,169 --> 03:05:19,774
YOU USED TO SHOOTING FISH IN A 

4447
03:05:17,239 --> 03:05:20,375
BARREL, BUT THAT'S GOTTEN 

4448
03:05:19,841 --> 03:05:25,147
HARDER.

4449
03:05:20,442 --> 03:05:28,350
WE'VE GOT PROBABLY 10 TO 15% OF 

4450
03:05:25,213 --> 03:05:30,385
OUR TOTAL ASSETS IN CASH BEYOND 

4451
03:05:28,416 --> 03:05:33,088
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE JUST 

4452
03:05:30,451 --> 03:05:36,491
AS A WAY OF PROTECTING OUR -- 

4453
03:05:33,155 --> 03:05:37,926
THE OWNERS, THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 

4454
03:05:36,558 --> 03:05:41,396
PARTNERS FROM EVER HAVING -- 

4455
03:05:37,993 --> 03:05:45,267
HAVING US EVER GET IN A PICKLE.

4456
03:05:41,463 --> 03:05:48,637
WE REALLY RUN BERKSHIRE THAT -- 

4457
03:05:45,333 --> 03:05:50,272
WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE OTHER 

4458
03:05:48,703 --> 03:05:52,741
PEOPLE'S MONEY WHO STICK WITH US

4459
03:05:50,339 --> 03:05:55,010
FOR YEARS.

4460
03:05:52,808 --> 03:05:57,212
WE CAN'T HELP IF SOMEBODY BUYS 

4461
03:05:55,077 --> 03:05:59,080
IT TODAY AND SELLS IT TOMORROW.

4462
03:05:57,279 --> 03:06:00,916
WE'VE GOT A GENE THAT PUSHES US 

4463
03:05:59,147 --> 03:06:04,052
IN THAT DIRECTION.

4464
03:06:00,983 --> 03:06:06,988
BUT WE'VE GOT PROBABLY 70 OR 80 

4465
03:06:04,119 --> 03:06:09,858
BILLION, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, 

4466
03:06:07,055 --> 03:06:10,125
MAYBE, THAT WE'D LOVE TO PUT TO 

4467
03:06:09,925 --> 03:06:16,298
WORK.

4468
03:06:10,192 --> 03:06:17,565
BUT THAT'S 10% OF OUR ASERSETS, 

4469
03:06:16,365 --> 03:06:20,401
ROUGHLY, AND WE PROBABLY 

4470
03:06:17,632 --> 03:06:22,471
WON'T -- WELL, WE WILL GET A 

4471
03:06:20,468 --> 03:06:24,773
CHANCE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, 

4472
03:06:22,537 --> 03:06:26,541
BUT CONDITIONS CHANGE VERY, 

4473
03:06:24,840 --> 03:06:28,777
VERY, VERY RAPIDLY SOMETIMES IN 

4474
03:06:26,608 --> 03:06:32,214
MARKETS, AND WE DO HAVE PEOPLE 

4475
03:06:28,843 --> 03:06:34,115
THAT WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US, BUT 

4476
03:06:32,280 --> 03:06:36,351
THE MARKET OPTION THEY HAVE IS 

4477
03:06:34,182 --> 03:06:38,520
JUST -- IS TOO GREAT FOR THEM.

4478
03:06:36,418 --> 03:06:40,922
IF THEY'RE PUBLICLY TRADED, I 

4479
03:06:38,587 --> 03:06:42,891
MEAN, THEY BASICALLY CAN'T -- 

4480
03:06:40,989 --> 03:06:44,760
THEY WOULD HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY

4481
03:06:42,958 --> 03:06:47,429
MAKING A DEAL WITH US BECAUSE 

4482
03:06:44,826 --> 03:06:48,530
SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD A COME ALONG

4483
03:06:47,496 --> 03:06:50,966
USING OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY.

4484
03:06:48,597 --> 03:06:53,635
IT'S -- YOU KNOW, WE MAY BE 

4485
03:06:51,033 --> 03:06:55,904
UNHAPPY ABOUT THE 70 BILLION BUT

4486
03:06:53,702 --> 03:06:56,638
WE'RE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE OTHER

4487
03:06:55,971 --> 03:06:57,339
700 BILLION.

4488
03:06:56,705 --> 03:07:02,911
IT'S NOT LIKE WE SHOULD 

4489
03:06:57,406 --> 03:07:05,714
COMPLAIN.

4490
03:07:02,978 --> 03:07:07,416
>> WHEN WE SPOKE AT THE ANNUAL 

4491
03:07:05,781 --> 03:07:09,117
MEETING YOU SAID IT WAS OK IF I 

4492
03:07:07,482 --> 03:07:09,751
ASKED A FOLLOW-UP.

4493
03:07:09,184 --> 03:07:11,920
>> YEAH.

4494
03:07:09,818 --> 03:07:13,955
>> YOU SAID YOU BOUGHT A LOT OF 

4495
03:07:11,987 --> 03:07:14,222
STOCKS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW 

4496
03:07:14,022 --> 03:07:14,856
ABOUT.

4497
03:07:14,289 --> 03:07:17,558
WHAT ARE THEY?

4498
03:07:14,923 --> 03:07:21,730
>> I WILL NOT GET INTO NAMING 

4499
03:07:17,625 --> 03:07:23,498
THE STOCKS, AND IT MAY BE THAT 

4500
03:07:21,796 --> 03:07:25,734
THERE'S SOME THERE THAT I THINK 

4501
03:07:23,565 --> 03:07:25,967
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BUT I KNOW 

4502
03:07:25,801 --> 03:07:28,904
ABOUT.

4503
03:07:26,034 --> 03:07:31,440
CHARLIE AND I, I MEAN, WE KNOW 

4504
03:07:28,970 --> 03:07:33,541
THE BUSINESS JIMMY BUT WE DON'T 

4505
03:07:31,506 --> 03:07:37,045
HAVE ANY INSIGHTS, AND THEY ARE 

4506
03:07:33,608 --> 03:07:38,546
AS A GROUP -- IF I HAD TO -- 

4507
03:07:37,112 --> 03:07:40,815
TOLD ME I WAS GOING TO BE 

4508
03:07:38,613 --> 03:07:43,485
SHOCKED AS I GOT THE BEST 

4509
03:07:40,882 --> 03:07:45,353
RESULT, I'D RATHER OWN THOSE 

4510
03:07:43,552 --> 03:07:47,689
STOCKS THAN THE TREASURY BILLS 

4511
03:07:45,420 --> 03:07:50,792
THAT WE OWN BUT WE WORK WITH 

4512
03:07:47,755 --> 03:07:52,527
QUANTITIES OF MONEY WHERE BE WE 

4513
03:07:50,859 --> 03:07:55,563
PUT 50 BILLION, THINGS I'M KIND 

4514
03:07:52,593 --> 03:07:56,631
OF SOCIAL ABOUT, BUT BETTER THAN

4515
03:07:55,630 --> 03:07:58,300
TREASURY BILLS.

4516
03:07:56,698 --> 03:08:00,802
I'M NOT WILDLY COMFORTABLE ABOUT

4517
03:07:58,367 --> 03:08:01,102
THAT, EVEN THOUGH IT CONCLUDE 

4518
03:08:00,869 --> 03:08:02,904
UNDONE.

4519
03:08:01,169 --> 03:08:04,406
SELLING 50 BILLION WHEN IT'S 

4520
03:08:02,971 --> 03:08:06,841
REALLY ATTRACTIVE TO BUY 

4521
03:08:04,472 --> 03:08:08,443
SOMETHING ELSE, THERE'S A LOT OF

4522
03:08:06,908 --> 03:08:10,378
SLIPPAGE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 

4523
03:08:08,509 --> 03:08:12,713
IN MOVING SUMS LIKE THAT AROUND.

4524
03:08:10,445 --> 03:08:13,415
THAT'S SOMETHING WE TALK ABOUT A

4525
03:08:12,780 --> 03:08:15,283
LOT OF TIME.

4526
03:08:13,482 --> 03:08:15,817
THEY'RE GOOD COMPANIES, FINE 

4527
03:08:15,350 --> 03:08:17,586
COMPANIES.

4528
03:08:15,884 --> 03:08:19,854
BUT DO WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT 

4529
03:08:17,652 --> 03:08:20,856
THOSE COMPANIES OR HAVE A WAY OF

4530
03:08:19,921 --> 03:08:24,025
EVALUATING THAT GIVES US THE 

4531
03:08:20,922 --> 03:08:26,861
EDGE O, THE ANSWER, I THINK -- 

4532
03:08:24,091 --> 03:08:28,263
WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT, 

4533
03:08:26,928 --> 03:08:29,931
CHARLIE.

4534
03:08:28,330 --> 03:08:31,933
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT A LOT.

4535
03:08:29,998 --> 03:08:34,936
OF COURSE, IT'S ALL HARDER.

4536
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:37,238
I THINK ONE CONSEQUENCE OF THE 

4537
03:08:35,003 --> 03:08:39,808
PRESENT SITUATION IS THAT BERNIE

4538
03:08:37,305 --> 03:08:41,243
SANDERS HAS BASICALLY WON AND 

4539
03:08:39,874 --> 03:08:42,811
THAT'S BECAUSE THE -- WITH 

4540
03:08:41,309 --> 03:08:45,413
THE -- EVERYTHING BOOMED UP SO 

4541
03:08:42,877 --> 03:08:48,049
HIGH AND INTEREST RATES SO LOW, 

4542
03:08:45,480 --> 03:08:49,951
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE 

4543
03:08:48,116 --> 03:08:52,187
MILLENNIAL GENERATION IS GOING 

4544
03:08:50,017 --> 03:08:53,755
TO HAVE A HELL OF A TIME GETTING

4545
03:08:52,253 --> 03:08:54,655
RATES COMPARED TO OUR 

4546
03:08:53,822 --> 03:08:56,858
GENERATION, SO THE DIFFERENCES 

4547
03:08:54,722 --> 03:08:59,361
BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR IN

4548
03:08:56,925 --> 03:09:01,496
THE GENERATION THAT'S RISING IS 

4549
03:08:59,427 --> 03:09:03,531
GOING TO BE A LOT LESS.

4550
03:09:01,563 --> 03:09:06,935
SO BERNIE HAS WON.

4551
03:09:03,598 --> 03:09:07,602
THEY IT BY ACCIDENT, BUT HE WON.

4552
03:09:07,002 --> 03:09:10,872
>> ALL RIGHT.

4553
03:09:07,669 --> 03:09:14,075
THIS QUESTION COMES FROM DENNY 

4554
03:09:10,939 --> 03:09:16,778
POLAND FROM PITTSBURGH.

4555
03:09:14,142 --> 03:09:20,315
A PROMINENT SENATOR RECENTLY 

4556
03:09:16,844 --> 03:09:23,418
CATEGORIZED SHARE BUY BACKS AS 

4557
03:09:20,381 --> 03:09:24,686
MARKET MA LIP LAS VEGAS.

4558
03:09:23,485 --> 03:09:26,521
COULD YOU AND CHARLIE PLEASE 

4559
03:09:24,753 --> 03:09:28,223
ELABORATE ON THE HIGHER ORDER 

4560
03:09:26,588 --> 03:09:31,493
EFFECT THAT THE SHARE 

4561
03:09:28,290 --> 03:09:34,429
REPURCHASES HAVE ON SOCIETY?

4562
03:09:31,560 --> 03:09:35,764
>> THEIR WAY ESSENTIALLY OF 

4563
03:09:34,495 --> 03:09:39,467
DISTRIBUTING CASH TO THE PEOPLE 

4564
03:09:35,831 --> 03:09:41,503
THAT WANT THE CASH WHEN OTHER 

4565
03:09:39,534 --> 03:09:41,870
CO-OWNERS MOSTLY WANT YOU TO 

4566
03:09:41,570 --> 03:09:43,004
REINVEST.

4567
03:09:41,937 --> 03:09:45,907
IT'S A SAVINGS VEHICLE.

4568
03:09:43,071 --> 03:09:48,476
IF THE FOUR OF US SITTING AT 

4569
03:09:45,974 --> 03:09:51,179
THIS TABLE DECIDED WE'D FORM A 

4570
03:09:48,543 --> 03:09:52,914
LITTLE CUP P COMPANY AND BUY A 

4571
03:09:51,245 --> 03:09:56,251
FEW FRANCHISES.

4572
03:09:52,981 --> 03:09:58,286
WE EACH PUT IN A BILLION, 

4573
03:09:56,317 --> 03:09:58,686
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND BUY THE

4574
03:09:58,353 --> 03:10:01,623
FRANCHISE.

4575
03:09:58,753 --> 03:10:05,326
THREE OF THE FOUR OF US WANT TO 

4576
03:10:01,689 --> 03:10:07,462
KEEP BUYING DWRAR QUEEN 

4577
03:10:05,393 --> 03:10:08,930
FRANCHISES, AND WE'RE IN THE 

4578
03:10:07,528 --> 03:10:10,965
WEALTH CREATION BUSINESS AND THE

4579
03:10:08,997 --> 03:10:13,268
FOURTH ONE SAYS, I'VE GOTTEN 

4580
03:10:11,032 --> 03:10:15,937
RICH ENOUGH, I'D RATHER TAKE 

4581
03:10:13,334 --> 03:10:18,339
SOME MONEY OUT AND, WELL, 

4582
03:10:16,004 --> 03:10:20,275
THERE'S ONLY TWO WAYS TO DO IT.

4583
03:10:18,406 --> 03:10:23,878
WE CAN PAY DIVIDENDS ALL FOUR OF

4584
03:10:20,342 --> 03:10:26,014
US, THREE OF US WHO DON'T WANT 

4585
03:10:23,945 --> 03:10:29,851
IT AND WE CAN REPURCHASE THE 

4586
03:10:26,081 --> 03:10:31,653
SHARE AT A FAIR PRICE, THE 

4587
03:10:29,918 --> 03:10:34,355
FOURTH ONE NATION A FAIR PRICE 

4588
03:10:31,720 --> 03:10:36,925
AND GETS BOUGHT OUT.

4589
03:10:34,422 --> 03:10:37,659
IT -- I FIND IT ALMOST 

4590
03:10:36,992 --> 03:10:39,494
IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE SOME OF 

4591
03:10:37,725 --> 03:10:41,930
THE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE MADE THAT

4592
03:10:39,561 --> 03:10:43,398
IT'S TERRIBLE TO DO REPURCHASE 

4593
03:10:41,996 --> 03:10:46,034
SHARES FROM A PARTNER IF THEY 

4594
03:10:43,465 --> 03:10:49,103
WANT TO GET OUT OF SOMETHING AND

4595
03:10:46,101 --> 03:11:00,114
YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT AT PRICES 

4596
03:10:49,170 --> 03:11:00,114
ADD ADVANTAGE D VANDAL TABLES.

4597
03:11:00,247 --> 03:11:03,718
WE HAD A VOTE ON.

4598
03:11:01,883 --> 03:11:05,520
WE'VE GOT SAVERS.

4599
03:11:03,785 --> 03:11:06,488
THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE WE'VE 

4600
03:11:05,587 --> 03:11:08,389
ADVERTISED OURSELVES AS BEING 

4601
03:11:06,554 --> 03:11:11,225
THAT SORT OF A VEHICLE.

4602
03:11:08,456 --> 03:11:14,963
WE'VE CREATED THAT AND STUCK 

4603
03:11:11,292 --> 03:11:18,266
WITH IT FOR 50-SOMETHING YEARS.

4604
03:11:15,030 --> 03:11:20,769
A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LOOK AT 

4605
03:11:18,333 --> 03:11:22,203
BERKSHIRE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO 

4606
03:11:20,835 --> 03:11:24,672
OWN TILL THEY DIE.

4607
03:11:22,270 --> 03:11:24,905
THE SAVERS GENERALLY KEEP 

4608
03:11:24,739 --> 03:11:28,610
SAVING.

4609
03:11:24,972 --> 03:11:32,080
WE JUST RECENTLY HAD SOMEBODY 

4610
03:11:28,676 --> 03:11:33,715
THAT FATHER CAME US 60 YEARS AGO

4611
03:11:32,147 --> 03:11:37,552
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

4612
03:11:33,782 --> 03:11:39,420
THEY JUST -- THEY WEREN'T SAVING

4613
03:11:37,619 --> 03:11:41,589
EXACTLY FOR THEIR OLD AGE.

4614
03:11:39,487 --> 03:11:44,926
IT'S JUST SORT OF BUILT INTO 

4615
03:11:41,656 --> 03:11:47,094
THEM THAT THEY DO IT.

4616
03:11:44,993 --> 03:11:51,165
IT'S THE MOST -- WHAT COULD BE 

4617
03:11:47,161 --> 03:11:53,635
MORE LOGICAL THAN IF A VERY 

4618
03:11:51,232 --> 03:11:56,905
SMALL NORTH MINORITY OF YOUR 

4619
03:11:53,702 --> 03:11:58,640
HOLDERS WANT TO GET IN AND THE 

4620
03:11:56,972 --> 03:12:01,576
OTHERS WANT TO STAY IN.

4621
03:11:58,707 --> 03:12:03,645
YOU GIVE THE MONEY TO THE ONE 

4622
03:12:01,643 --> 03:12:05,747
WHO WANTS IT AND YOU DO IT AT A 

4623
03:12:03,712 --> 03:12:06,080
PRICE THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO MOST

4624
03:12:05,814 --> 03:12:07,882
PARTIES.

4625
03:12:06,147 --> 03:12:08,917
ON A PRIVATE DEAL YOU'D WORK OUT

4626
03:12:07,949 --> 03:12:10,552
THE FAIR VALUE.

4627
03:12:08,984 --> 03:12:13,454
THE MARKET TELLS YOU THE VALUE 

4628
03:12:10,618 --> 03:12:14,856
IN THE CASE OF A PUBLICLY TRADED

4629
03:12:13,521 --> 03:12:15,924
COMPANY.

4630
03:12:14,923 --> 03:12:20,395
CHARLIE, GOT ANY -- 

4631
03:12:15,991 --> 03:12:23,665
>> WELL, I -- WHEN PURCHASING 

4632
03:12:20,462 --> 03:12:27,002
STOCK, JUST A BULLET HIGHER, 

4633
03:12:23,732 --> 03:12:28,169
IT'S DEEPLY IMMORAL, BUT IF 

4634
03:12:27,068 --> 03:12:29,638
YOU'RE REPURCHASING STOCK 

4635
03:12:28,236 --> 03:12:32,240
BECAUSE IT'S A FAIR THING TO DO 

4636
03:12:29,704 --> 03:12:33,407
IN THE INTEREST OF YOUR EXISTING

4637
03:12:32,307 --> 03:12:35,443
SHAREHOLDERS, IT'S A HIGHLY 

4638
03:12:33,474 --> 03:12:40,048
MORAL ACT AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

4639
03:12:35,510 --> 03:12:41,115
CRITICIZING IT ARE BONKERS.

4640
03:12:40,115 --> 03:12:43,418
>> OK.

4641
03:12:41,182 --> 03:12:46,021
THIS COMES FROM GARY GAMBINO.

4642
03:12:43,485 --> 03:12:47,655
HE WANTS TO KNOW IF BERKSHIRE 

4643
03:12:46,087 --> 03:12:49,324
WOULD SWITCH ITS CAPITAL RETURN 

4644
03:12:47,722 --> 03:12:51,459
POLICY TO DIVIDENDS FROM 

4645
03:12:49,391 --> 03:12:53,828
BUYBACKS IF THE CAPITAL RATES 

4646
03:12:51,525 --> 03:12:55,830
GAIN GOES UP.

4647
03:12:53,895 --> 03:12:56,631
DIVIDENDS WOULD BE FAR MORE 

4648
03:12:55,897 --> 03:12:58,733
TAXED ADVANTAGE FOR SHARE OLDERS

4649
03:12:56,698 --> 03:12:59,300
UNDER THAT SCENARIO.

4650
03:12:58,800 --> 03:13:02,637
>> YEAH.

4651
03:12:59,367 --> 03:13:08,409
WE HAD A -- WE LITERALLY DID 

4652
03:13:02,703 --> 03:13:09,076
HAVE A VOTE BY SHAREHOLDERS.

4653
03:13:08,476 --> 03:13:11,613
WE HAVE DIFFERENT SHAREHOLDERS 

4654
03:13:09,143 --> 03:13:13,982
THAN A REIT HAVE.

4655
03:13:11,680 --> 03:13:17,018
PEOPLE SELECT WHAT THEY GO INTO.

4656
03:13:14,049 --> 03:13:18,720
PEOPLE GOING INTO SPACS HOPES IT

4657
03:13:17,085 --> 03:13:21,656
GOES UP NEXT WEEK, BASICALLY.

4658
03:13:18,787 --> 03:13:23,558
AND WE'VE GOT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE 

4659
03:13:21,723 --> 03:13:23,758
WHO WERE ASSEMBLED OVER 55 

4660
03:13:23,625 --> 03:13:25,326
YEARS.

4661
03:13:23,825 --> 03:13:27,862
THEY STARTED WITH A BASE OF 

4662
03:13:25,393 --> 03:13:29,664
PEOPLE THAT IT WAS A LIFETIME 

4663
03:13:27,929 --> 03:13:32,333
INVESTMENT, AND IF THEY WANTED 

4664
03:13:29,731 --> 03:13:34,135
TO CASH OUT, THEY THOUGHT THEY'D

4665
03:13:32,400 --> 03:13:36,271
GET A FAIR PRICE AT THAT TIME.

4666
03:13:34,202 --> 03:13:38,205
BUT THEY BOUGHT IT WITH NO 

4667
03:13:36,337 --> 03:13:41,376
INTENTIONS LIKE THAT, SO WE HAD 

4668
03:13:38,272 --> 03:13:42,944
A VOTE AND I FEEL SOMETHING LIKE

4669
03:13:41,443 --> 03:13:44,379
97% OR SOMETHING OF THE SHARES 

4670
03:13:43,010 --> 03:13:45,313
THAT -- THEY DON'T WANT A 

4671
03:13:44,445 --> 03:13:47,448
DIFFICULT DENIED.

4672
03:13:45,380 --> 03:13:48,082
THAT WOULDN'T BE TRUE AT OTHER 

4673
03:13:47,515 --> 03:13:50,351
KMGS.

4674
03:13:48,149 --> 03:13:52,020
YOU'D BE CRAZY TO PAY A REGULAR 

4675
03:13:50,417 --> 03:13:53,988
EVENT LIKE COCA-COLA HAS DONE 

4676
03:13:52,086 --> 03:13:55,223
MANY YEARS AND THEY ALL OF A 

4677
03:13:54,055 --> 03:13:57,158
SUDDEN CHANGE THE POLICY ON 

4678
03:13:55,289 --> 03:13:59,093
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT IT

4679
03:13:57,225 --> 03:14:01,663
WITH ONE EXPECTATION IN MIND AND

4680
03:13:59,160 --> 03:14:02,864
TRY TO CHANGE IT INTO A 

4681
03:14:01,730 --> 03:14:05,433
DIFFERENT ANIMAL.

4682
03:14:02,931 --> 03:14:10,104
BUT COCA-COLA ISN'T GOING CHANGE

4683
03:14:05,500 --> 03:14:11,305
TO BERK IRAND BERKSHIRE WON'T 

4684
03:14:10,171 --> 03:14:13,174
CHANGE INTO COCA-COLA.

4685
03:14:11,372 --> 03:14:15,443
PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE EVERY DAY 

4686
03:14:13,241 --> 03:14:16,811
WHICH DO YOU WANT -- SORT OF 

4687
03:14:15,510 --> 03:14:18,479
THING YOU WANT TO BE IN.

4688
03:14:16,878 --> 03:14:22,116
AND BERKSHIRE IS A CERTAIN KIND 

4689
03:14:18,545 --> 03:14:24,852
OF ANIMAL IN THAT RESPECT.

4690
03:14:22,183 --> 03:14:28,122
>> SO WE WILL NOT -- IF THEY JIG

4691
03:14:24,919 --> 03:14:30,024
AROUND THE TAX LAWS, THAT'S NOT 

4692
03:14:28,189 --> 03:14:32,660
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DECISION,

4693
03:14:30,091 --> 03:14:34,128
WE'VE GOT A VERY SUBSTANTIAL 

4694
03:14:32,727 --> 03:14:37,632
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT WANT US 

4695
03:14:34,195 --> 03:14:39,734
TO REINVEST THE MONEY AND WHAT 

4696
03:14:37,699 --> 03:14:41,402
THEY'RE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT IT,

4697
03:14:39,801 --> 03:14:44,139
WHETHER WE FIND SOMETHING TO DO 

4698
03:14:41,469 --> 03:14:45,506
WITH THE MONEY AND REPURCHASING 

4699
03:14:44,205 --> 03:14:45,807
SHARES IS SOMETHING THAT HELPS 

4700
03:14:45,573 --> 03:14:48,342
THEM.

4701
03:14:45,874 --> 03:14:51,345
THEY OWN A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF 

4702
03:14:48,409 --> 03:14:53,314
BERKSHIRE AS THEY GO ALONG.

4703
03:14:51,412 --> 03:14:56,017
THEY'D LOVE TO SEE US BUY 

4704
03:14:53,381 --> 03:14:59,020
ANOTHER BUSINESS BUT THEY DON'T 

4705
03:14:56,083 --> 03:14:59,287
MIND INTENSIFYING THEIR 

4706
03:14:59,087 --> 03:15:02,023
INTEREST.

4707
03:14:59,354 --> 03:15:02,290
>> I'LL RUN THROUGH A FEW TAX 

4708
03:15:02,090 --> 03:15:03,758
QUESTIONS.

4709
03:15:02,357 --> 03:15:05,827
WE'LL SEE HOW MANY OF YOU ANSWER

4710
03:15:03,825 --> 03:15:08,863
BEFORE WE GET TO THEM.

4711
03:15:05,894 --> 03:15:09,097
THIS CAME FROM ARTHUR LEWIS IN 

4712
03:15:08,930 --> 03:15:10,231
DENVER.

4713
03:15:09,163 --> 03:15:13,234
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON 

4714
03:15:10,297 --> 03:15:14,869
CORPORATE TAX AND STEPPED UP 

4715
03:15:13,300 --> 03:15:17,171
BASIS TAX INCREASES?

4716
03:15:14,936 --> 03:15:18,205
>> WELL, IF CHARLIE WANTS TO 

4717
03:15:17,238 --> 03:15:22,110
ANSWER THAT, I'LL BE GLAD TO 

4718
03:15:18,272 --> 03:15:25,780
HAVE HIM DO IT.

4719
03:15:22,177 --> 03:15:32,053
I LONG AGO MANY TIMES HAVE SAID 

4720
03:15:25,847 --> 03:15:34,322
THAT I DON'T PUT MY OPINIONS OR 

4721
03:15:32,120 --> 03:15:38,326
ANYTHING IN A BLIND TRUST WHEN I

4722
03:15:34,389 --> 03:15:41,095
TAKE THIS JOB BUT I ALSO DON'T 

4723
03:15:38,392 --> 03:15:43,431
SPEAK FOR BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY.

4724
03:15:41,162 --> 03:15:43,631
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON 

4725
03:15:43,498 --> 03:15:44,866
TAXES.

4726
03:15:43,698 --> 03:15:46,768
I'VE EXPRESSED SOME THINGS IN 

4727
03:15:44,933 --> 03:15:49,270
THE PAST -- I DON'T LIKE TO 

4728
03:15:46,835 --> 03:15:52,273
SPEAK ON BEHALF WHEN I'M SITTING

4729
03:15:49,336 --> 03:15:53,908
IN AN ANNUAL MEETING PRESUMY 

4730
03:15:52,340 --> 03:15:55,676
SPEAKING FOR BERKSHIRE, I DON'T 

4731
03:15:53,974 --> 03:15:56,177
REALLY LIKE TO GET INTO 

4732
03:15:55,743 --> 03:15:58,346
POLITICAL QUESTIONS.

4733
03:15:56,243 --> 03:16:00,148
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD.

4734
03:15:58,413 --> 03:16:04,152
I ALSO THINK SOMEBODY ASKED ME 

4735
03:16:00,215 --> 03:16:06,487
WHO I VOTED FOR, PEOPLE BUY IT 

4736
03:16:04,219 --> 03:16:09,223
BUT I'VE NEVER ASKED A SINGLE 

4737
03:16:06,553 --> 03:16:14,162
EMPLOYEE OF OURS WHO THEY VOTED 

4738
03:16:09,290 --> 03:16:17,464
FOR, ANYTHING OF THE KIND, AND I

4739
03:16:14,229 --> 03:16:20,668
AM NOT AUTHORIZED TO GO AROUND 

4740
03:16:17,531 --> 03:16:21,669
SIGNING MY NAME AS CHAIRMAN OF 

4741
03:16:20,734 --> 03:16:22,970
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY.

4742
03:16:21,736 --> 03:16:25,973
THAT -- PROPOSALS.

4743
03:16:23,037 --> 03:16:26,874
IF I WRITE OP ED PIECES, I DO IT

4744
03:16:26,040 --> 03:16:30,110
AS AN INDIVIDUAL.

4745
03:16:26,941 --> 03:16:31,179
I TROO TO MAKE IT CLEAR, BECAUSE

4746
03:16:30,177 --> 03:16:32,280
I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THE 

4747
03:16:31,246 --> 03:16:36,350
MEETING TO GET A LOT ON TAXES.

4748
03:16:32,346 --> 03:16:41,289
CHARLIE.

4749
03:16:36,417 --> 03:16:47,562
>> NO, BUT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY

4750
03:16:41,356 --> 03:16:49,130
A MISTAKE TO BE BASICALLY ANY 

4751
03:16:47,629 --> 03:16:54,268
CAPITALIST, I THINK CAPITALISM 

4752
03:16:49,196 --> 03:16:58,673
IS WHAT RAISES GDP FOR 

4753
03:16:54,335 --> 03:17:02,110
EVERYBODY, AND SO -- AND I HAVE 

4754
03:16:58,740 --> 03:17:04,645
ALSO A FEELING THAT -- SOMEBODY 

4755
03:17:02,176 --> 03:17:08,349
WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID IT'S HARD

4756
03:17:04,712 --> 03:17:08,850
FOR AN EMPTY SACK TO STAND 

4757
03:17:08,416 --> 03:17:11,018
UPRIGHT.

4758
03:17:08,917 --> 03:17:11,986
IN SOME RESPECT IT HELPS THEM 

4759
03:17:11,085 --> 03:17:14,722
BEHAVE BETTER.

4760
03:17:12,053 --> 03:17:17,024
NOW, THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS.

4761
03:17:14,789 --> 03:17:17,191
AND PROMOTIONAL FINANCE IS THE 

4762
03:17:17,091 --> 03:17:19,894
ONE.

4763
03:17:17,257 --> 03:17:20,228
BY AND LARGE, FRANKLIN WAS 

4764
03:17:19,961 --> 03:17:23,764
RIGHT.

4765
03:17:20,295 --> 03:17:26,034
SO I'M A LITTLE WARY OF JUST 

4766
03:17:23,831 --> 03:17:27,969
CONSTANTLY BEING MAD AT PEOPLE 

4767
03:17:26,100 --> 03:17:29,670
BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE MONEY.

4768
03:17:28,036 --> 03:17:31,272
>> CHARLIE, THERE WAS A QUESTION

4769
03:17:29,737 --> 03:17:32,240
THAT CAME IN SPECIFICALLY TO YOU

4770
03:17:31,339 --> 03:17:35,710
ON TAX ISSUE.

4771
03:17:32,307 --> 03:17:38,345
OVER THE YEARS AND WITH EMPHASIS

4772
03:17:35,777 --> 03:17:40,248
IN 2020 WE'VE HEARD PEOPLE 

4773
03:17:38,412 --> 03:17:40,948
LEAVING CALIFORNIA FOR VARIOUS 

4774
03:17:40,315 --> 03:17:42,250
REASONS.

4775
03:17:41,015 --> 03:17:44,785
I UNDERSTAND YOU BELIEVE IT'S 

4776
03:17:42,317 --> 03:17:47,021
DUMB FOR STATES TO HAVE POLICIES

4777
03:17:44,852 --> 03:17:48,522
AND LAWS THAT PROMOTE RICH 

4778
03:17:47,088 --> 03:17:50,791
RESIDENTS LEAVING.

4779
03:17:48,589 --> 03:17:51,458
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THOSE 

4780
03:17:50,858 --> 03:17:54,195
PEOPLE LEAVING.

4781
03:17:51,525 --> 03:17:56,864
WHAT KEEPS YOU IN CALIFORNIA?

4782
03:17:54,262 --> 03:17:57,298
>> THAT'S A INTERESTING 

4783
03:17:56,931 --> 03:18:01,736
QUESTION.

4784
03:17:57,365 --> 03:18:04,205
I HAD ONE SAID I WOULDN'T MOVE 

4785
03:18:01,802 --> 03:18:04,405
ACROSS THE STREET TO DO THE 

4786
03:18:04,272 --> 03:18:05,840
TAXES.

4787
03:18:04,472 --> 03:18:06,407
THAT'S MY PERMANENT VIEW ON THE 

4788
03:18:05,907 --> 03:18:08,342
SUBJECT.

4789
03:18:06,474 --> 03:18:11,412
BUT I DO THINK IT'S SAFER FOR 

4790
03:18:08,409 --> 03:18:12,847
STATES TO DRIVE OUT THEIR 

4791
03:18:11,479 --> 03:18:15,583
WEALTHIEST CITIZENS.

4792
03:18:12,914 --> 03:18:17,218
THE OLD PEOPLE DON'T COMMIT 

4793
03:18:15,650 --> 03:18:18,519
CRIMES, THEY DON'T PLEDGE TO THE

4794
03:18:17,285 --> 03:18:21,889
LOCAL CHARITY.

4795
03:18:18,586 --> 03:18:24,258
WHO IN THE HELL IN THEIR RIGHT 

4796
03:18:21,956 --> 03:18:24,491
MAP WOULD DRIVE OUT THE RICH 

4797
03:18:24,325 --> 03:18:26,961
PEOPLE.

4798
03:18:24,558 --> 03:18:29,563
FLORIDA AND PLACES LINING THAT 

4799
03:18:27,028 --> 03:18:31,832
ARE SHREWD AND PLACES LIKE 

4800
03:18:29,630 --> 03:18:33,267
CALIFORNIA ARE BEING VERY 

4801
03:18:31,899 --> 03:18:35,336
STUPID.

4802
03:18:33,334 --> 03:18:36,203
IT'S CONTRARY TO THE INTEREST OF

4803
03:18:35,403 --> 03:18:40,007
THE STATE.

4804
03:18:36,270 --> 03:18:43,311
>> JACK ROB IPS ASKS, HOW WILL 

4805
03:18:40,074 --> 03:18:43,578
THE TAX RATE AFFECT BERKSHIRE 

4806
03:18:43,378 --> 03:18:45,079
COMPANIES?

4807
03:18:43,645 --> 03:18:47,047
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK IT WOULD 

4808
03:18:45,145 --> 03:18:49,083
BE THE END OF THE WORLD.

4809
03:18:47,114 --> 03:18:50,418
WE'LL ADAPT TO THE INTEREST 

4810
03:18:49,150 --> 03:18:52,687
RATE, WHATEVER IT IS.

4811
03:18:50,485 --> 03:18:55,990
>> I WOULD SAY IF THEY RAISE THE

4812
03:18:52,754 --> 03:18:57,558
TAX RATE, THEY'RE OWNING -- THE 

4813
03:18:56,056 --> 03:18:58,593
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S OPENING A 

4814
03:18:57,624 --> 03:19:00,928
LARGER PERCENTAGE OF BUSINESS.

4815
03:18:58,659 --> 03:19:03,097
I'M NOT SAYING WHAT THE TAX RATE

4816
03:19:00,995 --> 03:19:05,466
IS BUT WE HAVE A CLASS A STOCK 

4817
03:19:03,164 --> 03:19:06,968
AND A CLASS B STOCK.

4818
03:19:05,533 --> 03:19:08,703
THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT OWNS WHAT

4819
03:19:07,035 --> 03:19:10,838
I CALL THE CLASS AA STOCK.

4820
03:19:08,770 --> 03:19:13,774
THEY GET A PERCENTAGE OF THE 

4821
03:19:10,905 --> 03:19:15,776
EARNINGS BUT THEY DON'T OWN THE 

4822
03:19:13,841 --> 03:19:17,345
ASSETS AND DON'T VOTE ON WHO 

4823
03:19:15,843 --> 03:19:19,080
RUBS THE PLACE OR ANYTHING ELSE.

4824
03:19:17,412 --> 03:19:22,750
BUT IF THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO 

4825
03:19:19,146 --> 03:19:24,885
START -- WHEN I STARTED WITH 52%

4826
03:19:22,817 --> 03:19:27,421
THE GOVERNMENT DID FOR CORPORATE

4827
03:19:24,952 --> 03:19:30,124
PROFITS, AND THEY'VE GOT -- WHAT

4828
03:19:27,488 --> 03:19:32,126
WOULD YOU PAY TO OWN THE 

4829
03:19:30,191 --> 03:19:32,460
GOVERNMENT'S CLASS A DOUBLE-A 

4830
03:19:32,193 --> 03:19:33,828
STOCK?

4831
03:19:32,527 --> 03:19:37,531
IF THERE WAS A PUBLIC ISSUE BY 

4832
03:19:33,895 --> 03:19:39,901
THE U.S. TREASURY AND THEY SAID 

4833
03:19:37,598 --> 03:19:42,870
THIS VEHICLE, GIVEN A NAME LIKE 

4834
03:19:39,967 --> 03:19:45,573
SPAC OR SOMETHING, EVEN SEXIER, 

4835
03:19:42,937 --> 03:19:47,708
BUT ALL IT WILL DO IS IT OWNS 

4836
03:19:45,639 --> 03:19:49,276
THE FUTURE TAX PAYMENTS OF 

4837
03:19:47,775 --> 03:19:52,013
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY FOREVER.

4838
03:19:49,343 --> 03:19:53,147
AND HOW MUCH IS THAT STOCK NOW 

4839
03:19:52,080 --> 03:19:58,352
WORTH?

4840
03:19:53,214 --> 03:19:58,619
IF IT WILL PAY A BIG CASH 

4841
03:19:58,419 --> 03:20:00,488
DIVIDEND.

4842
03:19:58,686 --> 03:20:04,325
IT'S WORTH MORE IF IT'S -- IF 

4843
03:20:00,554 --> 03:20:05,860
THE TAX RATE IS 25% OR 28% OR 

4844
03:20:04,392 --> 03:20:16,971
52% OR 21%.

4845
03:20:05,927 --> 03:20:18,673
THEY OWN A SPECIAL STOCK AND 

4846
03:20:17,037 --> 03:20:22,176
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT PASSING 

4847
03:20:18,739 --> 03:20:23,478
THROUGH TO THE CUSTOMER, IN THE 

4848
03:20:22,243 --> 03:20:25,379
KMRG BUSINESS IT DOES BUT IT 

4849
03:20:23,544 --> 03:20:25,846
DOESN'T IN MOST OF OUR 

4850
03:20:25,446 --> 03:20:29,183
BUSINESSES.

4851
03:20:25,913 --> 03:20:31,285
IT'S A CORPORATE FICTION WHEN 

4852
03:20:29,249 --> 03:20:32,720
THEY PUT OUT SEGMENTS ABOUT THE 

4853
03:20:31,352 --> 03:20:35,323
FACT THAT THIS WILL BE TERRIBLE 

4854
03:20:32,787 --> 03:20:37,958
FOR ALL OF YOU PEOPLE WHO PAY 

4855
03:20:35,389 --> 03:20:40,862
MORE TAXES.

4856
03:20:38,025 --> 03:20:42,963
IT HURTS THE BERKSHIRE 

4857
03:20:40,928 --> 03:20:43,297
SHAREHOLDERS IF RATES ARE 

4858
03:20:43,030 --> 03:20:44,698
HIGHER.

4859
03:20:43,364 --> 03:20:46,400
THAT MAY BE QUITE APPROPRIATE 

4860
03:20:44,765 --> 03:20:47,501
BUT TO SAY OTHERWISE, IT DOESN'T

4861
03:20:46,467 --> 03:20:49,837
MAKE ANY SENSE.

4862
03:20:47,568 --> 03:20:50,938
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE 

4863
03:20:49,903 --> 03:20:52,673
GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY ISSUE -- 

4864
03:20:51,005 --> 03:20:55,710
THEY COULD HAVE -- I MEAN, THEY 

4865
03:20:52,739 --> 03:20:57,111
COULD SET UP A COMPANY, CALL IT 

4866
03:20:55,776 --> 03:20:58,513
DID BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY TAX 

4867
03:20:57,177 --> 03:21:01,348
COMPANY AND IT WOULD TAKE ALL 

4868
03:20:58,579 --> 03:21:02,250
THE TAXES WE PAY EVERY YEAR.

4869
03:21:01,415 --> 03:21:04,718
HOW MUCH WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO 

4870
03:21:02,316 --> 03:21:06,454
SELL THAT ASSET FOR?

4871
03:21:04,785 --> 03:21:07,688
THEY TALK ABOUT UNFUNDED 

4872
03:21:06,521 --> 03:21:09,389
OBLIGATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

4873
03:21:07,755 --> 03:21:10,391
THAT'S AN UNREPORTED ASSET OF 

4874
03:21:09,456 --> 03:21:15,162
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

4875
03:21:10,458 --> 03:21:16,730
THEY OWN PART OF BHERKERKSHIRE  

4876
03:21:15,229 --> 03:21:18,199
THEY GET TO DETERMINE A LOT.

4877
03:21:16,797 --> 03:21:21,035
IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION.

4878
03:21:18,266 --> 03:21:24,872
>> ONE LAST TAX QUESTION.

4879
03:21:21,102 --> 03:21:26,741
THIS ONE COMES FROM WILLIAM 

4880
03:21:24,938 --> 03:21:28,876
BARNARD WHO SAYS A PORTION OF 

4881
03:21:26,807 --> 03:21:32,713
YOUR ANNUAL REPORT YOU STATE ON 

4882
03:21:28,942 --> 03:21:34,448
MY DEATH NONE OF MY STONG WILL 

4883
03:21:32,780 --> 03:21:36,684
HAVE TO BE SOLD.

4884
03:21:34,515 --> 03:21:42,389
WILL THE RECENT BIDEN PROPOSAL 

4885
03:21:36,751 --> 03:21:44,825
TO TREAT GAINS AS SOLD AND DEATH

4886
03:21:42,456 --> 03:21:45,626
43.4% FOR PAGE OF TAXES UPON 

4887
03:21:44,891 --> 03:21:47,728
YOUR DEATH. 

4888
03:21:45,693 --> 03:21:48,963
>> THE TAX LAW CAN BE CHANGED 

4889
03:21:47,794 --> 03:21:51,365
TOMORROW AND I DON'T -- IT CAN 

4890
03:21:49,030 --> 03:21:52,633
BE DONE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS.

4891
03:21:51,432 --> 03:21:54,435
IT'S BEEN DONE A LOT OF 

4892
03:21:52,700 --> 03:21:56,270
DIFFERENT WAYS IN THE PAST.

4893
03:21:54,502 --> 03:21:59,640
I CAN TELL YOU -- I CAN ACTUALLY

4894
03:21:56,337 --> 03:22:01,676
MAKE A PROMISE.

4895
03:21:59,707 --> 03:22:03,244
99.7% OF WHAT I HAVE WHEN I DIE 

4896
03:22:01,742 --> 03:22:03,677
WILL GO TO THEM OR THE FEDERAL 

4897
03:22:03,311 --> 03:22:04,345
GOVERNMENT.

4898
03:22:03,744 --> 03:22:08,149
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN 

4899
03:22:04,411 --> 03:22:11,085
DETERMINE THE RULES ON THAT.

4900
03:22:08,216 --> 03:22:12,019
AND I WOULD PREFER THAT IT WOULD

4901
03:22:11,152 --> 03:22:15,389
GO TO PHILANTHROPY.

4902
03:22:12,086 --> 03:22:17,924
I THINK IT WILL ACCOMPLISH MORE 

4903
03:22:15,456 --> 03:22:22,863
UTILITY IF IT GOES TO BE USED BY

4904
03:22:17,991 --> 03:22:27,768
SOME SMART PEOPLE IN FLAP THROW 

4905
03:22:22,930 --> 03:22:29,470
BY THAN IF IT REDUCES THE 

4906
03:22:27,835 --> 03:22:32,073
FEDERAL KET WHEN I DIE.

4907
03:22:29,537 --> 03:22:33,207
I DON'T THINK IT MAKES A DAMN 

4908
03:22:32,139 --> 03:22:34,842
BIT OF DIFFERENCE.

4909
03:22:33,274 --> 03:22:35,242
IT WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE 

4910
03:22:34,909 --> 03:22:38,179
WORLD.

4911
03:22:35,309 --> 03:22:39,813
IT DOESN'T SAVE THEM ANYTHING OR

4912
03:22:38,246 --> 03:22:40,247
THEY CAN BORROW A BILLION OR 

4913
03:22:39,880 --> 03:22:42,750
ANYWAY.

4914
03:22:40,314 --> 03:22:43,017
BUT THAT CONDITION WON'T 

4915
03:22:42,817 --> 03:22:44,819
PREVAIL.

4916
03:22:43,084 --> 03:22:46,353
I WOULD NOT REGARD -- I'M JUST 

4917
03:22:44,885 --> 03:22:49,790
TALKING PERSONALLY.

4918
03:22:46,420 --> 03:22:50,591
I'M NOT ADVOCATING THIS AS 

4919
03:22:49,856 --> 03:22:53,093
PUBLIC POLICY, BUT IF THEY TOOK 

4920
03:22:50,657 --> 03:22:53,894
IT ALL, IT WOULD NOT BOTHER ME.

4921
03:22:53,160 --> 03:22:57,665
>> I GUARANTEE IT WON'T BOTHER 

4922
03:22:53,961 --> 03:22:59,600
YOU.

4923
03:22:57,732 --> 03:23:02,270
YOU WON'T KNOW.

4924
03:22:59,667 --> 03:23:05,539
>> THE -- YOU KNOW, IF YOU 

4925
03:23:02,336 --> 03:23:06,640
DECIDE -- IF THE AMERICAN 

4926
03:23:05,606 --> 03:23:08,809
DEPARTMENT DECIDES IT'S BETTER 

4927
03:23:06,707 --> 03:23:09,810
TO TAKE IT ALL -- WHICH I DON'T 

4928
03:23:08,875 --> 03:23:12,313
THINK THEY WILL AND I DON'T 

4929
03:23:09,877 --> 03:23:14,882
THINK THEY SHOULD, BUT 

4930
03:23:12,380 --> 03:23:17,051
NEVERTHELESS, SO WHAT?

4931
03:23:14,949 --> 03:23:20,254
YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT

4932
03:23:17,118 --> 03:23:21,622
USED TO ACCOMPLISH THE MOST FOR 

4933
03:23:20,321 --> 03:23:25,459
HUMANITY.

4934
03:23:21,689 --> 03:23:27,761
AND THAT MEANS HAVING SMART 

4935
03:23:25,526 --> 03:23:31,932
PEOPLE PROPERLY MOTIVATED AND 

4936
03:23:27,828 --> 03:23:33,033
MORE IMPORTANTLY, NOT IMPROPERLY

4937
03:23:31,999 --> 03:23:35,136
MOTIVATED, DISTRIBUTE IT IN A 

4938
03:23:33,100 --> 03:23:38,372
WAY AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HELL 

4939
03:23:35,202 --> 03:23:38,973
IT WOULD BE 10, 20, 30, 40 YEARS

4940
03:23:38,439 --> 03:23:40,474
FROM NOW.

4941
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:41,976
I KNOW IF IT GOES TO THE 

4942
03:23:40,540 --> 03:23:43,477
GOVERNMENT IT REDUCES THE 

4943
03:23:42,043 --> 03:23:45,613
NATIONAL DEBT BY THAT AMOUNT.

4944
03:23:43,544 --> 03:23:47,614
I DON'T THINK IT CHANGES WHETHER

4945
03:23:45,680 --> 03:23:48,649
THEY CHANGE MINIMUM WAGE LAWS OR

4946
03:23:47,681 --> 03:23:50,951
ANYTHING ELSE.

4947
03:23:48,716 --> 03:23:53,220
I JUST THINK THAT LITTLE FIGURE 

4948
03:23:51,018 --> 03:23:56,190
CHANGES, IT WILL SHOW UP IN THE 

4949
03:23:53,287 --> 03:23:59,493
BUDGET ONE DAY, RECEIVED FROM 

4950
03:23:56,256 --> 03:23:59,927
BUFFETT X AND A HUGE FIGURE DOWN

4951
03:23:59,560 --> 03:24:01,829
BELOW.

4952
03:23:59,994 --> 03:24:03,597
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD REALLY --

4953
03:24:01,896 --> 03:24:04,531
I WOULD PREFER IT BE USED 

4954
03:24:03,664 --> 03:24:06,667
PRIVATELY BUT THAT'S UP TO THE 

4955
03:24:04,598 --> 03:24:07,768
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES THAT

4956
03:24:06,734 --> 03:24:08,335
DECIDE THROUGH THEIR 

4957
03:24:07,835 --> 03:24:12,339
REPRESENTATIVES.

4958
03:24:08,402 --> 03:24:15,209
>> NOW, THIS NEXT QUESTION IS 

4959
03:24:12,406 --> 03:24:18,846
FOR AJIT.

4960
03:24:15,276 --> 03:24:21,849
IT COMES FROM SOMEBODY WHO SAYS 

4961
03:24:18,912 --> 03:24:24,151
MR. JAIN, WHAT HAS IT TAUGHT US 

4962
03:24:21,916 --> 03:24:28,222
ABOUT SYSTEMIC AND CORRELATED 

4963
03:24:24,217 --> 03:24:29,056
RISK AND IS THERE ANYTHING WE 

4964
03:24:28,289 --> 03:24:31,659
WILL WE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY 

4965
03:24:29,123 --> 03:24:33,494
FROM NOW ON?

4966
03:24:31,725 --> 03:24:34,495
>> WE AUTOMATIC THINK ABOUT 

4967
03:24:33,560 --> 03:24:36,163
PANDEMIC AS ONE OF THE RISK 

4968
03:24:34,561 --> 03:24:36,764
FACTORS THAT WE NEED TO HOLD IN 

4969
03:24:36,229 --> 03:24:39,100
OUR BUSINESS.

4970
03:24:36,830 --> 03:24:41,669
HAVING SAID THAT, I THINK THE 

4971
03:24:39,166 --> 03:24:44,771
BIG LESSON FOR US, HAVING GONE 

4972
03:24:41,735 --> 03:24:46,474
THROUGH WHOOEF GONE THROUGH 

4973
03:24:44,838 --> 03:24:48,075
RECENTLY IS THAT WHILE WE WERE 

4974
03:24:46,540 --> 03:24:52,112
AWARE THAT THE FACT THAT 

4975
03:24:48,141 --> 03:24:53,046
PANDEMIC RISK IS A RISK FACTOR, 

4976
03:24:52,179 --> 03:24:55,916
IF IT'S TOTALLY UNDERPRICED BY 

4977
03:24:53,113 --> 03:24:58,586
ALL OF US IN THE INDUSTRY.

4978
03:24:55,983 --> 03:25:00,253
IT'S AN EVENT THAT HAPPENED AT 

4979
03:24:58,652 --> 03:25:02,723
MOST EVERY HUNDRED YEARS, AND 

4980
03:25:00,320 --> 03:25:03,557
EVEN THEN, THE ODDS ARE PRETTY 

4981
03:25:02,790 --> 03:25:06,760
HIGH.

4982
03:25:03,624 --> 03:25:09,397
I THINK THE BIG LESSON FOR US IS

4983
03:25:06,827 --> 03:25:10,698
TO RETHINK ABOUT WHAT IT IS FOR 

4984
03:25:09,463 --> 03:25:13,200
A PANDEMIC RISK.

4985
03:25:10,765 --> 03:25:15,569
AND SEPARATELY, WE HAVEN'T YET 

4986
03:25:13,266 --> 03:25:17,171
DONE A GOOD ENOUGH JOB AS AN 

4987
03:25:15,636 --> 03:25:20,007
INDUSTRY, I'M SAYING, IN TERMS 

4988
03:25:17,238 --> 03:25:21,609
OF CORRELATING THE KISK RISK AND

4989
03:25:20,074 --> 03:25:23,243
MAKING SURE THEY CAN DEAL WITH 

4990
03:25:21,675 --> 03:25:27,314
THE AGGREGATE NUMBERS.

4991
03:25:23,310 --> 03:25:29,150
FOR EXAMPLE, PANDEMIC RISK HAS 

4992
03:25:27,380 --> 03:25:32,920
TAKEN PEOPLE'S LIVES, BUT THEN 

4993
03:25:29,216 --> 03:25:34,488
SEPARATELY A BUNCH OF US USED TO

4994
03:25:32,987 --> 03:25:36,890
WRITE SOMETHING CALLED EVENT 

4995
03:25:34,554 --> 03:25:37,157
CANCELLATION OR CONTINGENCY 

4996
03:25:36,957 --> 03:25:43,397
POLICY.

4997
03:25:37,224 --> 03:25:46,300
IN TERMS OF PRICING FOR THE 

4998
03:25:43,464 --> 03:25:46,567
CONTINGENCY, SHOULD THE OLYMPICS

4999
03:25:46,367 --> 03:25:48,769
CANCEL.

5000
03:25:46,634 --> 03:25:50,804
WHEN PRICING SOMETHING LIKE THAT

5001
03:25:48,836 --> 03:25:53,107
WE WOULD THINK IN TERMS OF 

5002
03:25:50,871 --> 03:25:55,576
EARTHQUAKE AND RISK AND MORE 

5003
03:25:53,174 --> 03:25:57,811
RECENTLY TERRORISM BUT YOU WOULD

5004
03:25:55,643 --> 03:25:59,046
NEVER FACTOR SOMETHING LIKE WHAT

5005
03:25:57,877 --> 03:26:01,815
PORTION OF THE PRICE SHOULD COME

5006
03:25:59,113 --> 03:26:04,885
FROM THE PANDEMIC EXPOSURE.

5007
03:26:01,882 --> 03:26:09,489
I THINK THE INDUSTRY WILL BECOME

5008
03:26:04,952 --> 03:26:12,459
A LOT MORE SOPHISTICATED.

5009
03:26:09,556 --> 03:26:12,860
AS OPPOSED TO IT BEING 

5010
03:26:12,526 --> 03:26:15,496
LOCALIZED.

5011
03:26:12,927 --> 03:26:22,569
>> DON ASKED IF ANYONE ELSE ON 

5012
03:26:15,562 --> 03:26:22,903
THE STAGE WANTS TO COMMENT AFTER

5013
03:26:22,636 --> 03:26:23,103
A

5014
03:26:22,969 --> 03:26:26,407
AJIT.

5015
03:26:23,169 --> 03:26:28,108
>> HE WANTED TO ASK IF ANYBODY 

5016
03:26:26,473 --> 03:26:32,346
ELSE ON THE TABLE WANTS TO 

5017
03:26:28,175 --> 03:26:36,116
COMMENT ON.

5018
03:26:32,413 --> 03:26:38,152
>> AS AJIT SAID, LOTS OF PEOPLE 

5019
03:26:36,182 --> 03:26:40,554
BUY INSURANCE AGAINST THE 

5020
03:26:38,219 --> 03:26:42,589
OLYMPICS BEING CANCELED OR THE 

5021
03:26:40,621 --> 03:26:45,592
UNITED STATES NO PARTICIPATING.

5022
03:26:42,656 --> 03:26:47,294
YOU THINK OF ALL SORTS OF RISK.

5023
03:26:45,659 --> 03:26:50,998
THEY HAVE AD CAMPAIGNS -- 

5024
03:26:47,361 --> 03:26:52,099
THERE'S A LOT OF CANCELLATION 

5025
03:26:51,065 --> 03:26:54,969
INSURANCE, AND IT WAS PROBABLY 

5026
03:26:52,165 --> 03:26:57,872
UNDER PRICED THE IMPLICIT PART 

5027
03:26:55,035 --> 03:27:01,475
OF THAT PREMIUM THAT WAS 

5028
03:26:57,938 --> 03:27:03,610
ATTRIBUTABLE TO A PANDEMIC RESK.

5029
03:27:01,542 --> 03:27:06,280
BILL GATES GAVE A TERRIFIC TALK 

5030
03:27:03,677 --> 03:27:09,316
AND TED FIVE OR SINGS YEARS AGO 

5031
03:27:06,347 --> 03:27:10,584
AND PEOPLE IGNORED IT AND IT'S 

5032
03:27:09,383 --> 03:27:12,319
VERY INTERESTING.

5033
03:27:10,651 --> 03:27:14,488
THIS ISN'T A WORST CASE WHAT 

5034
03:27:12,386 --> 03:27:18,358
WE'VE SEEN AND YET IT'S 

5035
03:27:14,555 --> 03:27:24,298
STAGGERING MANY TERMS OF WHAT 

5036
03:27:18,425 --> 03:27:30,737
HAS HAPPENED AND PEOPLE THAT 

5037
03:27:24,365 --> 03:27:32,239
BOTH INSURANCE THAT -- THEY MAY 

5038
03:27:30,804 --> 03:27:34,575
HAVE THOUGHT OUT SOMETIMES THEY 

5039
03:27:32,306 --> 03:27:37,044
WERE COVERING THINGS THEY DIDN'T

5040
03:27:34,642 --> 03:27:38,211
INTEND TOP COVER AND MAYBE 

5041
03:27:37,111 --> 03:27:40,981
INSURANCE P DIDN'T THINK THEY 

5042
03:27:38,278 --> 03:27:43,350
WERE BUYING BUT NEVERTHELESS 

5043
03:27:41,048 --> 03:27:45,486
AFTER THE FACT IS THEY GET 

5044
03:27:43,417 --> 03:27:47,154
INSLEPTIVE IN COMING AFTER THEM.

5045
03:27:45,553 --> 03:27:47,855
THERE ARE CERTAIN RISKS THAT ARE

5046
03:27:47,221 --> 03:27:49,590
TOO BIG.

5047
03:27:47,921 --> 03:27:51,258
THE NUKE RISK, FOR EXAMPLE.

5048
03:27:49,657 --> 03:27:53,260
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS VERY 

5049
03:27:51,324 --> 03:27:56,330
EARLY ON RECOGNIZING THAT 

5050
03:27:53,327 --> 03:27:58,665
PRIVATE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, THEY

5051
03:27:56,397 --> 03:28:00,668
CAN'T HANDLE A -- THE RISK 

5052
03:27:58,732 --> 03:28:01,735
INVOLVED IN -- THE FINANCIAL 

5053
03:28:00,734 --> 03:28:04,204
RISK THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED IN 

5054
03:28:01,802 --> 03:28:07,941
TERMS OF A MASSIVE NUCLEAR 

5055
03:28:04,270 --> 03:28:11,712
STRIKE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

5056
03:28:08,008 --> 03:28:14,982
SO IT'S -- PANDEMICS, THE 

5057
03:28:11,778 --> 03:28:16,850
WORDING WILL BE MUCH MORE 

5058
03:28:15,049 --> 03:28:19,186
CAREFUL IN FUTURE POLICIES ON 

5059
03:28:16,917 --> 03:28:19,953
TRYING TO DIVIDE IT VERY 

5060
03:28:19,253 --> 03:28:21,288
PRECISELY.

5061
03:28:20,020 --> 03:28:23,457
INCIDENTALLY IN THE WAY THE 

5062
03:28:21,355 --> 03:28:25,392
CASES HAVE COME SO FAR, IN THE 

5063
03:28:23,523 --> 03:28:27,528
UNITED KINGDOM -- I THINK THERE 

5064
03:28:25,459 --> 03:28:30,797
WAS ONE PARTICULARLY INSURER -- 

5065
03:28:27,594 --> 03:28:33,066
THE CASES ARE COMING DOWN MUCH 

5066
03:28:30,864 --> 03:28:35,002
TOUGHER ON THE INSURERS, THE 

5067
03:28:33,133 --> 03:28:37,037
UNITED STATES, I MEAN, THE 

5068
03:28:35,069 --> 03:28:37,337
POLICIES WERE WRITTEN 

5069
03:28:37,104 --> 03:28:39,373
DIFFERENTLY.

5070
03:28:37,404 --> 03:28:41,475
YOU DON'T GET INSURANCE ON 

5071
03:28:39,439 --> 03:28:43,010
SOMETHING YOU DON'T BUY AGAINST.

5072
03:28:41,542 --> 03:28:46,080
GENERALLY THE COURT DECISIONS 

5073
03:28:43,077 --> 03:28:47,648
HAVE COME DOWN FAVORABLE TO THE 

5074
03:28:46,146 --> 03:28:49,549
INSURERS AND AT BERKSHIRE IT 

5075
03:28:47,714 --> 03:28:55,155
HAPPENS THAT WE'RE NOT A BIG 

5076
03:28:49,616 --> 03:28:57,891
PLAYER BRKS BUT THAT'S IN 

5077
03:28:55,222 --> 03:28:59,927
COMMERCIAL MOLDABLE MIGHT BE 

5078
03:28:57,958 --> 03:29:01,061
WHERE -- IT'S NOT A HUGE FACTOR 

5079
03:28:59,993 --> 03:29:04,131
FOR BERKSHIRE.

5080
03:29:01,128 --> 03:29:07,067
>> THIS IS FROM MARTIN DEFINE 

5081
03:29:04,197 --> 03:29:08,936
AND ASKED AJIT AND WARREN WHAT'S

5082
03:29:07,134 --> 03:29:11,805
YOUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE 

5083
03:29:09,003 --> 03:29:12,105
INSURANCE EXPOSURE FROM THE 

5084
03:29:11,872 --> 03:29:14,308
PANDEMIC?

5085
03:29:12,172 --> 03:29:15,643
>> WELL, IN TERMS OF RESERVES 

5086
03:29:14,374 --> 03:29:17,511
STARTING FROM LAST YEAR TO THE 

5087
03:29:15,709 --> 03:29:20,347
END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS

5088
03:29:17,578 --> 03:29:21,748
YEAR, WE HAVE PUT UP A BILLION 

5089
03:29:20,414 --> 03:29:23,751
SIX IN CHANGE.

5090
03:29:21,815 --> 03:29:25,552
WHAT THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO 

5091
03:29:23,817 --> 03:29:28,455
ACCOUNT IS SOME OF THE FREQUENCY

5092
03:29:25,619 --> 03:29:30,290
BENEFIT BECAUSE OF COVID-19 THAT

5093
03:29:28,522 --> 03:29:32,893
RESULTS BECAUSE OF FEWER 

5094
03:29:30,356 --> 03:29:34,394
ACCIDENTS AND GEICO HAS HAD A 

5095
03:29:32,959 --> 03:29:36,830
HUGE TAIL WIND BECAUSE OF THAT.

5096
03:29:34,461 --> 03:29:39,232
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE INSURANCE 

5097
03:29:36,896 --> 03:29:41,001
OPERATIONS COLLECTIVELY ARE 

5098
03:29:39,299 --> 03:29:43,337
GOING TO BE WRITING CHECKS FOR, 

5099
03:29:41,067 --> 03:29:44,972
THAT NUMBER AS OF NOW IS ABOUT A

5100
03:29:43,404 --> 03:29:47,341
BEING SIX.

5101
03:29:45,039 --> 03:29:47,808
MY QUESTIONS IS IT WILL PROBABLY

5102
03:29:47,408 --> 03:29:49,677
GROW.

5103
03:29:47,875 --> 03:29:51,979
IF YOU LOOK UPON IT -- THE 

5104
03:29:49,743 --> 03:29:52,246
INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE, WE 

5105
03:29:52,046 --> 03:29:54,615
RESERVED.

5106
03:29:52,313 --> 03:29:58,452
THE ASTRO AS A WHOLE HAS RESCHED

5107
03:29:54,682 --> 03:29:59,620
ABOUT 25 TO $30 BILLION FOR 19 

5108
03:29:58,519 --> 03:30:02,122
AS OF NOW.

5109
03:29:59,687 --> 03:30:03,823
IF YOU BELIEVE THE PUNDITS THEY 

5110
03:30:02,189 --> 03:30:06,059
WILL TELL YOU THAT NUMBER IS 

5111
03:30:03,890 --> 03:30:06,393
PROBABLY CLOSER TO A HUNDRED 

5112
03:30:06,126 --> 03:30:09,830
BILLION.

5113
03:30:06,460 --> 03:30:12,666
THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED, 175 

5114
03:30:09,896 --> 03:30:15,636
LOSSES THAT NEED TO FLOW 

5115
03:30:12,733 --> 03:30:15,936
THROUGH, INSURANCE, INCOME 

5116
03:30:15,703 --> 03:30:18,905
STATEMENT.

5117
03:30:16,003 --> 03:30:21,375
THE FAVOR OF 1.6 WE HAVE AS OF 

5118
03:30:18,972 --> 03:30:23,477
NOW IS GOING TO BE A LOT, LOT 

5119
03:30:21,442 --> 03:30:24,211
HIGHER BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE

5120
03:30:23,544 --> 03:30:26,113
CAN'T MANAGE.

5121
03:30:24,278 --> 03:30:26,480
>> WE WILL NOT BE IN THE TOP 

5122
03:30:26,179 --> 03:30:27,914
FIVE -- 

5123
03:30:26,546 --> 03:30:30,484
>> RIGHT.

5124
03:30:27,981 --> 03:30:34,755
>> -- PAIRS OF INSURANCE CLAIMS,

5125
03:30:30,551 --> 03:30:38,158
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE -- AND IT'S --

5126
03:30:34,822 --> 03:30:44,431
WE WRITE A MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTED

5127
03:30:38,225 --> 03:30:44,931
OF BOTH LIFE INSURANCE AND 

5128
03:30:44,498 --> 03:30:48,001
ANNUITIES.

5129
03:30:44,998 --> 03:30:48,402
WE HAVE MORE LIFE INSURANCE 

5130
03:30:48,068 --> 03:30:50,404
CRIMES.

5131
03:30:48,469 --> 03:30:51,271
MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIED THAT

5132
03:30:50,471 --> 03:30:52,639
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE GOT 

5133
03:30:51,337 --> 03:30:55,442
PAYMENTS UNDER ANNUITIES.

5134
03:30:52,706 --> 03:30:57,611
IT CUTS A LOT OF WASTE.

5135
03:30:55,509 --> 03:31:01,682
IT'S A -- ONE OF THE GREAT HUMAN

5136
03:30:57,678 --> 03:31:04,084
TAFRS OF ALL TIME BUT IS NOT -- 

5137
03:31:01,749 --> 03:31:05,452
THAT IS BEING INSURANCE -- IF 

5138
03:31:04,151 --> 03:31:08,021
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THINK 

5139
03:31:05,519 --> 03:31:10,224
THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE A HUNDRED 

5140
03:31:08,088 --> 03:31:11,792
BILLION DOLLARS, THE HUNDRED 

5141
03:31:10,290 --> 03:31:12,426
BILLION OUGHT TO BE ON THEIR 

5142
03:31:11,858 --> 03:31:16,029
BOOKS NOW.

5143
03:31:12,493 --> 03:31:18,464
YOU'VE GOT A LIABILITY, AND OUR 

5144
03:31:16,096 --> 03:31:21,468
GOAL IS NOT -- OUR GOAL IS TO 

5145
03:31:18,531 --> 03:31:25,438
HAVE -- PUT UP THE LIABILITY 

5146
03:31:21,535 --> 03:31:28,575
WHEN WE THINK IT'S HAPPENED AND 

5147
03:31:25,505 --> 03:31:30,410
THEN IF -- WE SHOULD NOT BE AT A

5148
03:31:28,642 --> 03:31:32,378
BILLION SIX, I WOULD SAY THIS.

5149
03:31:30,477 --> 03:31:34,281
IF WE REALLY THINK WE'RE GOING 

5150
03:31:32,445 --> 03:31:38,218
TO HAVE SOME PROPORTIONAL SHARE 

5151
03:31:34,347 --> 03:31:41,922
OF A HUNDRED BILLION, BUT -- 

5152
03:31:38,285 --> 03:31:44,124
WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH SAID ON 

5153
03:31:41,989 --> 03:31:46,493
THAT.

5154
03:31:44,191 --> 03:31:46,927
>> FOR GREG AND WARREN AND 

5155
03:31:46,560 --> 03:31:49,296
CHARLIE.

5156
03:31:46,994 --> 03:31:50,964
BLARE MILLER ASKS WHAT DOES THE 

5157
03:31:49,362 --> 03:31:53,000
COMBINATION OF KANSAS CITY 

5158
03:31:51,031 --> 03:31:55,435
SOUTHERN WITH EITHER CANADIAN 

5159
03:31:53,066 --> 03:31:57,537
PACIFIC OF CANADIAN NATIONAL BE 

5160
03:31:55,502 --> 03:31:59,206
TO SF IN TERMS OF COMPETITION 

5161
03:31:57,604 --> 03:32:01,775
AND DO YOU THINK THE SYNERGIES 

5162
03:31:59,272 --> 03:32:02,408
OF THE MERGER WILL JUSTIFY THE 

5163
03:32:01,841 --> 03:32:03,210
MULTIPLE PAID?

5164
03:32:02,475 --> 03:32:07,414
>> SURE.

5165
03:32:03,277 --> 03:32:09,683
SO OBVIOUSLY, A TRANSACTION WE 

5166
03:32:07,481 --> 03:32:11,284
FOLLOW CLOSELY WITH BOTH 

5167
03:32:09,749 --> 03:32:14,321
CANADIAN NATIONAL AND CANADIAN 

5168
03:32:11,351 --> 03:32:16,490
PACIFIC BIDDING TO PURCHASE 

5169
03:32:14,387 --> 03:32:18,558
KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN, EITHER OF 

5170
03:32:16,556 --> 03:32:20,393
THOSE COMPANIES ACQUIRING KANSAS

5171
03:32:18,625 --> 03:32:24,998
CITY SOUTHERN WILL HAVE AN 

5172
03:32:20,460 --> 03:32:26,166
IMPACT ON BNSF.

5173
03:32:25,065 --> 03:32:29,002
WHAT THEY'RE BASICALLY PROPOSING

5174
03:32:26,233 --> 03:32:31,638
IS TO CREATE A NORTH-SOUTH 

5175
03:32:29,068 --> 03:32:32,606
RAILWAY THAT GOES FROM CANADA 

5176
03:32:31,705 --> 03:32:36,243
INTO MEXICO.

5177
03:32:32,673 --> 03:32:37,944
WE DO HAVE A STRONG PRESENCE IN 

5178
03:32:36,310 --> 03:32:40,346
MEXICO, NOT AS STRONG AS SOME OF

5179
03:32:38,011 --> 03:32:43,517
OUR COMPETITION, BUT WE WOULD 

5180
03:32:40,413 --> 03:32:45,986
FEEL COMPETITION THERE, SO WE'LL

5181
03:32:43,584 --> 03:32:46,353
FOLLOW THAT TRANSACTION VERY 

5182
03:32:46,053 --> 03:32:49,022
CLOSELY.

5183
03:32:46,420 --> 03:32:50,290
AS IT GOES BEFORE THE SURFACE 

5184
03:32:49,088 --> 03:32:53,260
TRANSPORTATION BOARD, THE 

5185
03:32:50,357 --> 03:32:54,527
STANDARD THAT WILL BE APPLIED IS

5186
03:32:53,327 --> 03:32:57,264
COMPETITION HAS TO BE PROTECTED 

5187
03:32:54,594 --> 03:32:59,065
OR ENHANCED, SO THAT'S OUR 

5188
03:32:57,330 --> 03:33:01,368
OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT OUR 

5189
03:32:59,132 --> 03:33:02,135
FRANCHISE ON BEHALF OF OUR 

5190
03:33:01,435 --> 03:33:04,004
CUSTOMERS.

5191
03:33:02,202 --> 03:33:06,139
SO WE MOVE IN A MOBILE BUSINESS 

5192
03:33:04,070 --> 03:33:08,408
BOTH IN AND OUT OF THERE ON 

5193
03:33:06,206 --> 03:33:09,810
BEHALF OF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.

5194
03:33:08,475 --> 03:33:11,278
WE'LL WANT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS

5195
03:33:09,877 --> 03:33:13,146
OF OUR CUSTOMERS THERE, SO WE'LL

5196
03:33:11,345 --> 03:33:14,548
BE ACTIVE IN THE APPROVAL 

5197
03:33:13,213 --> 03:33:17,417
PROCESS, BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION

5198
03:33:14,615 --> 03:33:18,451
AT THE END IT IMPACTS OUR 

5199
03:33:17,484 --> 03:33:19,286
FRANCHISE.

5200
03:33:18,518 --> 03:33:20,487
WARREN.

5201
03:33:19,353 --> 03:33:26,593
>> YEAH.

5202
03:33:20,554 --> 03:33:30,630
IT'S NOT HUGE, BUT IT AFFECTION 

5203
03:33:26,659 --> 03:33:33,033
BOTH THE UNION PACIFIC AND BNSF 

5204
03:33:30,697 --> 03:33:34,767
TO A SBHAUL DEGREE, PROBABLY 

5205
03:33:33,099 --> 03:33:36,837
SMALL DEGREE BUT THAT'S NOT THE 

5206
03:33:34,834 --> 03:33:37,504
WORRY OF THE SERVICE 

5207
03:33:36,903 --> 03:33:41,241
TRANSPORTATION BOARD.

5208
03:33:37,571 --> 03:33:43,744
THEIR JOB IS TO DO WHAT'S BEST 

5209
03:33:41,308 --> 03:33:50,850
FOR THE SCHIPPERS, AND IN TERMS 

5210
03:33:43,810 --> 03:33:54,554
OF THE PRICE THAT'S BEING PAID, 

5211
03:33:50,917 --> 03:33:56,323
YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAY, WHEN -- IF

5212
03:33:54,621 --> 03:33:58,791
YOU CAN BORROW THE MONEY NOTHING

5213
03:33:56,390 --> 03:34:00,527
FOR NOTHING, IT WOULDN'T MAKE 

5214
03:33:58,858 --> 03:34:02,195
MUCH DIFFERENCE TO PEOPLE AND 

5215
03:34:00,593 --> 03:34:04,231
THIS WOULD NOT BE BEING PAID 

5216
03:34:02,262 --> 03:34:04,531
UNDER A DIFFERENT INTEREST RATE 

5217
03:34:04,298 --> 03:34:11,305
ENVIRONMENT.

5218
03:34:04,598 --> 03:34:13,640
IT'S VERY SIMPLE, BUT IT WOULD 

5219
03:34:11,371 --> 03:34:14,441
MAKE -- THERE'S NO MAGIC TO THE 

5220
03:34:13,707 --> 03:34:18,645
KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN.

5221
03:34:14,507 --> 03:34:21,815
IT'S GOT A -- I THINK -- THE OLD

5222
03:34:18,712 --> 03:34:27,954
MEXICO ENDS IN 2047.

5223
03:34:21,882 --> 03:34:29,990
IT'S -- IT WILL -- THE NUMBER OF

5224
03:34:28,021 --> 03:34:32,759
CAR LOADS CARRIED, WHATEVER, IS 

5225
03:34:30,056 --> 03:34:35,161
NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT MUCH.

5226
03:34:32,826 --> 03:34:38,865
BUT IT IS KIND OF INTERESTING.

5227
03:34:35,228 --> 03:34:41,868
THERE'S ONLY -- THERE'S TWO 

5228
03:34:38,932 --> 03:34:43,503
MAJOR CANADIAN WHAT THEY CALL 

5229
03:34:41,935 --> 03:34:46,640
CLASS ONE RAILROADS AND THERE'S 

5230
03:34:43,569 --> 03:34:48,709
FIVE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND 

5231
03:34:46,706 --> 03:34:52,512
THIS WILL RESULT IN ESSENTIALLY 

5232
03:34:48,775 --> 03:34:53,747
THREE OF THE UNITS BEING 

5233
03:34:52,579 --> 03:34:55,882
CANADIAN, FOUR BEING U.S., WHICH

5234
03:34:53,814 --> 03:34:58,986
IS NOT THE WAY IT NORMALLY -- 

5235
03:34:55,948 --> 03:35:00,020
THE WAY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 

5236
03:34:59,052 --> 03:35:00,820
RAILROAD SYSTEM WOULD WORK IN 

5237
03:35:00,087 --> 03:35:04,791
THE UNITED STATES.

5238
03:35:00,887 --> 03:35:10,163
BUT IT'S -- WE'VE TALKED ABOUT 

5239
03:35:04,858 --> 03:35:11,965
IT PLENTY AND CP OR EITHER 

5240
03:35:10,229 --> 03:35:13,533
CANADIAN NATIONAL LIKELY TO 

5241
03:35:12,031 --> 03:35:14,968
GET -- I THINK THE 

5242
03:35:13,600 --> 03:35:16,770
TRANSPORTATION BOARD WHO VOTED 

5243
03:35:15,034 --> 03:35:18,739
THE OTHER DAY DIDN'T GET -- 

5244
03:35:16,836 --> 03:35:21,174
>> THEY VOTED ON AN INITIAL 

5245
03:35:18,805 --> 03:35:22,976
TRUST STRUCTURE THAT THEY HAD TO

5246
03:35:21,241 --> 03:35:26,579
APPROVE FOR CANADIAN PACIFIC AND

5247
03:35:23,043 --> 03:35:27,713
THAT WAS A 4-1 VOTE, AS YOU 

5248
03:35:26,646 --> 03:35:29,649
NOTED, WARREN. 

5249
03:35:27,780 --> 03:35:31,852
>> YEAH.

5250
03:35:29,716 --> 03:35:33,887
NORMALLY RAILROAD DEALS ARE A 

5251
03:35:31,918 --> 03:35:35,188
VERY LONG -- TAKES A LONG TIME 

5252
03:35:33,954 --> 03:35:40,260
FOR THEM TO EVALUATE.

5253
03:35:35,255 --> 03:35:40,894
IN THIS CASE I THINK THEY HAVE 

5254
03:35:40,326 --> 03:35:43,663
TWO OPPOSING TRUST PROPOSALS AND

5255
03:35:40,960 --> 03:35:45,565
IN EFFECT, BY MAKING A -- IF 

5256
03:35:43,730 --> 03:35:48,101
THEY MAKE A QUICK DECISION ON 

5257
03:35:45,631 --> 03:35:51,605
WHICH TRUST PROPOSAL WILL THEY 

5258
03:35:48,168 --> 03:35:52,439
ALLOW, I DON'T SAY THEY ALLOW 

5259
03:35:51,671 --> 03:35:55,442
TWO PROPOSALS EXACTLY.

5260
03:35:52,506 --> 03:35:55,709
SO IT MAY BE A VERY ACCELERATED 

5261
03:35:55,509 --> 03:35:56,276
DECISION.

5262
03:35:55,776 --> 03:35:57,778
I DON'T KNOW.

5263
03:35:56,343 --> 03:36:00,814
IT'S UP TO THE TRANSPORTATION 

5264
03:35:57,844 --> 03:36:01,414
BOARD TO DO WHAT'S WEST FOR WHAT

5265
03:36:00,881 --> 03:36:04,985
THEIR OBLIGATION IS TO THE 

5266
03:36:01,481 --> 03:36:06,853
COUNTRY TO DO.

5267
03:36:05,052 --> 03:36:07,287
>> THERE WAS A FOLLOW-UP 

5268
03:36:06,920 --> 03:36:07,821
QUESTION -- 

5269
03:36:07,353 --> 03:36:09,589
>> SURE.

5270
03:36:07,888 --> 03:36:10,991
>> DO YOU THINK THE VALUATION 

5271
03:36:09,656 --> 03:36:15,028
THAT THEY'RE PAYING IS WORTH IT?

5272
03:36:11,058 --> 03:36:17,797
>> WELL, I -- WE HAVE -- IN A 

5273
03:36:15,095 --> 03:36:20,633
VERY, VERY MILD WAY.

5274
03:36:17,864 --> 03:36:21,868
EVERYBODY'S KIND OF PLAYED DEALS

5275
03:36:20,700 --> 03:36:24,604
WITH DIFFERENT RAILROADS EVER 

5276
03:36:21,934 --> 03:36:26,539
SINGS I'VE BEEN IN THE RAILROAD 

5277
03:36:24,671 --> 03:36:27,440
BUSINESS, SO -- WE'VE TALKED 

5278
03:36:26,606 --> 03:36:36,116
ABOUT IT.

5279
03:36:27,507 --> 03:36:42,322
ONE CP, WHEN -- HARRISON CAME 

5280
03:36:36,182 --> 03:36:46,893
AFTER -- WAS IT C.P. KIND OF LED

5281
03:36:42,389 --> 03:36:49,329
THE WAY WE LOOKED AT BUYING CP.

5282
03:36:46,960 --> 03:36:53,133
EVERYBODY LOOKS AT EVERYTHING 

5283
03:36:49,395 --> 03:36:57,370
AND WE WOULD NOT PAY THIS PRICE 

5284
03:36:53,199 --> 03:37:00,507
AND APPLIES FOR A PRICE OF BNSF 

5285
03:36:57,437 --> 03:37:09,115
THAN WHAT THE UP IS SELLING FOR.

5286
03:37:00,574 --> 03:37:09,749
BUT IT'S KIND OF PLAIN MOPLAY 

5287
03:37:09,182 --> 03:37:13,353
MONEY.

5288
03:37:09,816 --> 03:37:13,753
CP AND CN, THERE'S ONLY ONE KC 

5289
03:37:13,420 --> 03:37:15,455
SOUTHERN.

5290
03:37:13,820 --> 03:37:18,491
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUY US, 

5291
03:37:15,522 --> 03:37:20,060
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUY THE 

5292
03:37:18,557 --> 03:37:22,295
U.P. AND THE JUICES FLOW AND THE

5293
03:37:20,127 --> 03:37:23,997
PRICES GO UP -- 

5294
03:37:22,362 --> 03:37:25,498
>> HANDLE SOMEBODY ELSE'S MONEY.

5295
03:37:24,064 --> 03:37:27,200
>> SOMEBODY ELSE'S MONEY AND 

5296
03:37:25,565 --> 03:37:30,370
YOU'RE GOING TO RETIRE IN FIVE 

5297
03:37:27,266 --> 03:37:32,606
OR TEN YEARS AND PEOPLE WON'T 

5298
03:37:30,436 --> 03:37:34,474
REMEMBER WHAT YOU PAID BUT THE 

5299
03:37:32,672 --> 03:37:36,943
INVESTMENT BANKERS ARE CHEERING 

5300
03:37:34,540 --> 03:37:38,378
YOU ON AT EVERY MOVE.

5301
03:37:37,010 --> 03:37:40,914
THEY'RE MOVING THE FIGURES 

5302
03:37:38,445 --> 03:37:43,683
AROUND, THE SPREADSHEETS ARE OUT

5303
03:37:40,981 --> 03:37:45,986
AND THE THINGS ARE FLOWING FROM.

5304
03:37:43,750 --> 03:37:49,823
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM 

5305
03:37:46,052 --> 03:37:52,592
ASHER HAFT IN BROOKLYN, WHO 

5306
03:37:49,890 --> 03:37:54,160
SAYS -- HE'S BEEN A SHAREHOLDER 

5307
03:37:52,658 --> 03:37:57,097
SINCE 2016.

5308
03:37:54,227 --> 03:37:59,799
SAYS THAT HE APPRECIATES YOUR 

5309
03:37:57,164 --> 03:38:02,368
HONESTY AND CANDIDNESS IN 

5310
03:37:59,865 --> 03:38:02,969
EXPLAINING COSTLY ERRORS YOU 

5311
03:38:02,435 --> 03:38:06,239
MADE.

5312
03:38:03,036 --> 03:38:08,208
YOU MADE A MISTAKE IN 2016 WHEN 

5313
03:38:06,305 --> 03:38:11,311
AVERAGE AMOUNT OF FUTURE 

5314
03:38:08,275 --> 03:38:12,345
EARNINGS WHICH PAID BERKSHIRE IN

5315
03:38:11,378 --> 03:38:14,180
ACQUIRING ITS.

5316
03:38:12,412 --> 03:38:16,783
THEY DECLINED IN 2020 BECAUSE OF

5317
03:38:14,247 --> 03:38:18,151
THE PANDEMIC AND THE EFFECT ON 

5318
03:38:16,850 --> 03:38:19,853
AIRLINE AND TRAVEL INDUSTRY.

5319
03:38:18,218 --> 03:38:22,088
WHAT CALCULATIONS COULD YOU HAVE

5320
03:38:19,920 --> 03:38:24,724
MADE IN 2016 THAT MIGHT HAVE 

5321
03:38:22,154 --> 03:38:26,593
ALTERED YOUR DECISION TO HAVE IT

5322
03:38:24,791 --> 03:38:29,329
AND ARE THE PROBLEMS THEY'RE 

5323
03:38:26,659 --> 03:38:29,662
CURRENTLY FACING LARGER THAN THE

5324
03:38:29,396 --> 03:38:31,431
PANDEMIC.

5325
03:38:29,729 --> 03:38:31,664
>> BERKSHIRE DIDN'T MAKE THE 

5326
03:38:31,498 --> 03:38:33,867
MISTAKE.

5327
03:38:31,731 --> 03:38:35,068
I MADE THE MISTAKE.

5328
03:38:33,934 --> 03:38:37,337
THE -- NO.

5329
03:38:35,135 --> 03:38:40,039
I -- ANYTIME WE LOOK AT BUYING A

5330
03:38:37,404 --> 03:38:41,508
BUSINESS, WE'RE EVALUATING THE 

5331
03:38:40,106 --> 03:38:42,976
STRENGTH OF THE BUSINESS, THE 

5332
03:38:41,574 --> 03:38:44,511
PRICE WE HAVE TO PAY, THE 

5333
03:38:43,042 --> 03:38:46,179
MANAGEMENT WE GET AND EVERYTHING

5334
03:38:44,578 --> 03:38:50,050
AND WE DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE ON 

5335
03:38:46,245 --> 03:38:58,258
THE MANAGEMENT, BUT IN TERMS OF 

5336
03:38:50,116 --> 03:39:00,693
THE EARNING POWER ON AVERAGE AND

5337
03:38:58,325 --> 03:39:03,229
WHEN BOEING HAS TROUBLE WITH 

5338
03:39:00,760 --> 03:39:05,398
MAXWELL, THAT'S A PROBABILITY.

5339
03:39:03,296 --> 03:39:07,867
HIM IN ANY CUSTOMERS HAVE BIG --

5340
03:39:05,465 --> 03:39:10,236
ALL KINDS OF THINGS COULD 

5341
03:39:07,934 --> 03:39:13,039
HAPPEN, AND WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF

5342
03:39:10,303 --> 03:39:15,341
THOSE THINGS HAPPEN AND 

5343
03:39:13,106 --> 03:39:17,010
THEREFORE, I PAID TOO MUCH IN 

5344
03:39:15,408 --> 03:39:21,748
RELATION TO AVERAGE EARNINGS.

5345
03:39:17,077 --> 03:39:24,150
IT'S A TERRIFIC COMPANY AND, YOU

5346
03:39:21,815 --> 03:39:26,453
KNOW, IT'S -- I'LL HAPPY WITH 

5347
03:39:24,217 --> 03:39:31,457
THE MANAGEMENT AND EVERYTHING, 

5348
03:39:26,519 --> 03:39:35,094
BUT G.E. DOESN'T

5349
03:39:31,524 --> 03:39:36,529
THEY GET INTO THE POWER 

5350
03:39:35,161 --> 03:39:37,897
BUSINESS, A VARIETY OF THINGS.

5351
03:39:36,596 --> 03:39:39,999
AND WE'RE IN THE BUSINESSES.

5352
03:39:37,964 --> 03:39:41,567
BUT WE DID NOT THINK THOSE 

5353
03:39:40,066 --> 03:39:43,936
BUSINESSES WOULD NECESSARILY BE 

5354
03:39:41,634 --> 03:39:46,105
IN SOMETHING CLOSE TO A 

5355
03:39:44,003 --> 03:39:48,174
DEPRESSION WHEN OTHER BUSINESSES

5356
03:39:46,172 --> 03:39:49,943
THAT WE BOUGHT END UP SOMETIMES 

5357
03:39:48,241 --> 03:39:51,511
DOING BETTER THAN WE THINK.

5358
03:39:50,010 --> 03:39:51,811
BUT WE'LL CONTINUE MAKING 

5359
03:39:51,578 --> 03:39:55,048
MISTAKES.

5360
03:39:51,878 --> 03:39:56,249
I MEAN -- AND I SHOULDN'T SAY WE

5361
03:39:55,115 --> 03:39:56,782
WILL.

5362
03:39:56,316 --> 03:40:01,587
I WILL.

5363
03:39:56,849 --> 03:40:04,523
>> THE OTHERS WILL HELP. 

5364
03:40:01,654 --> 03:40:05,958
>> AND, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'VE 

5365
03:40:04,590 --> 03:40:08,528
GOT SOME WONDERFUL DEALS AND 

5366
03:40:06,025 --> 03:40:11,464
SOME TERRIBLE DEALS.

5367
03:40:08,595 --> 03:40:15,635
AND THE NICE THING ABOUT IT IS, 

5368
03:40:11,531 --> 03:40:17,303
AS I POINTED OUT, THIS DOESN'T 

5369
03:40:15,702 --> 03:40:19,772
REALLY APPLY IN THE CASE OF 

5370
03:40:17,370 --> 03:40:21,774
PRECISION, BUT WHEN WE'RE 

5371
03:40:19,839 --> 03:40:23,242
DISAPPOINTED IN THE BUSINESS IT 

5372
03:40:21,841 --> 03:40:24,210
USUALLY BECOMES A SMALLER AND 

5373
03:40:23,309 --> 03:40:26,479
SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF OUR 

5374
03:40:24,277 --> 03:40:28,347
BUSINESS JUST BY THE NATURE OF 

5375
03:40:26,546 --> 03:40:29,048
THINGS BECAUSE IT ISN'T GOING 

5376
03:40:28,414 --> 03:40:32,218
ANY PLACE.

5377
03:40:29,115 --> 03:40:34,020
WHEN WE GET A SUCCESSFUL 

5378
03:40:32,285 --> 03:40:36,289
BUSINESS, LIKE A GEICO -- 

5379
03:40:34,086 --> 03:40:37,723
THEY'RE DOING 15 TIME AS MUCH 

5380
03:40:36,356 --> 03:40:38,958
BUSINESS AS WHEN WE BOUGHT 

5381
03:40:37,790 --> 03:40:40,826
CONTROL OF THEM.

5382
03:40:39,025 --> 03:40:41,995
THEY'VE BECOME A MORE IMPORTANT 

5383
03:40:40,893 --> 03:40:45,265
PART OF OUR MIX.

5384
03:40:42,062 --> 03:40:45,998
SO YOU REALLY GET JUST THROUGH 

5385
03:40:45,331 --> 03:40:48,167
NATURAL FORCES YOU GET MORE OF 

5386
03:40:46,065 --> 03:40:50,370
YOUR MONEY IN THINGS THAT HAVE 

5387
03:40:48,234 --> 03:40:51,404
DEVELOPED MORE FAVORABLY THAN 

5388
03:40:50,437 --> 03:40:53,572
YOU THOUGHT.

5389
03:40:51,471 --> 03:40:54,840
YOU ACTUALLY END UP GETTING A 

5390
03:40:53,639 --> 03:40:55,808
GREATER CONCENTRATION IN THE 

5391
03:40:54,907 --> 03:40:59,512
THINGS THAT WORK OUT.

5392
03:40:55,875 --> 03:41:00,580
AS CHARLIE WOULD SAY, IT'S NOT 

5393
03:40:59,579 --> 03:41:05,351
LIKE HAVING CHILDREN.

5394
03:41:00,647 --> 03:41:05,618
THE BAD ONES CAUSE YOU MORE 

5395
03:41:05,418 --> 03:41:06,919
PROBLEMS.

5396
03:41:05,685 --> 03:41:10,656
BUT IN THE CHILDREN OF 

5397
03:41:06,986 --> 03:41:12,125
BUSINESSES, THE SMALL ONES KIND 

5398
03:41:10,723 --> 03:41:16,662
OF -- WE STARTED WITH THREE 

5399
03:41:12,192 --> 03:41:19,231
BUSINESSES, CHARLIE AND I, AND 

5400
03:41:16,729 --> 03:41:20,400
BERKSHIRE WAS TEXTILES, AND 

5401
03:41:19,298 --> 03:41:21,934
DEPARTMENT STORE AND TRADING 

5402
03:41:20,467 --> 03:41:23,469
STAMPS, BLUE CHIPS BUSINESS, AND

5403
03:41:22,001 --> 03:41:25,037
THOSE WERE THE THREE COMPANIES 

5404
03:41:23,536 --> 03:41:26,539
WE PUT TOGETHER, AND ALL THREE 

5405
03:41:25,104 --> 03:41:30,143
OF THE ORIGINAL BUSINESSES 

5406
03:41:26,606 --> 03:41:32,545
FAILED, WHICH SORT OF GETS ME IN

5407
03:41:30,210 --> 03:41:34,080
TERMS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE WORRIED

5408
03:41:32,612 --> 03:41:37,717
ABOUT, DON'T WE KNOW THAT COAL 

5409
03:41:34,147 --> 03:41:38,151
IS GOING TO BE PHASED OUT OVER 

5410
03:41:37,784 --> 03:41:39,619
TIME?

5411
03:41:38,218 --> 03:41:42,322
OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT.

5412
03:41:39,686 --> 03:41:43,856
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GOING TO

5413
03:41:42,388 --> 03:41:45,057
BE PHASED OUT OVER TIME.

5414
03:41:43,923 --> 03:41:46,159
EVERY BUSINESS HAS A LOT TO 

5415
03:41:45,124 --> 03:41:47,627
THINK ABOUT THAT WAY.

5416
03:41:46,226 --> 03:41:48,728
THE BIGGEST DANGER, THEY HAVE 

5417
03:41:47,694 --> 03:41:53,199
THAT SECTION IN THE PERSPECTIVES

5418
03:41:48,795 --> 03:41:54,100
CALLED -- WHAT DO THEY CALL THAT

5419
03:41:53,266 --> 03:41:55,368
ABOUT CERTAIN -- 

5420
03:41:54,167 --> 03:41:57,036
>> RISK FACTORS?

5421
03:41:55,435 --> 03:41:59,972
>> RISK FACTORS, YEAH.

5422
03:41:57,103 --> 03:42:01,007
THE YOU BE IN ONE RISK FACTOR IS

5423
03:42:00,039 --> 03:42:02,408
THAT THIS BUSINESS GETS THE 

5424
03:42:01,074 --> 03:42:05,544
WRONG MANAGEMENT.

5425
03:42:02,475 --> 03:42:10,416
AND GET A GUY OR A WOMAN IN 

5426
03:42:05,611 --> 03:42:11,784
CHARGE OF IT THAT THEY ARE 

5427
03:42:10,483 --> 03:42:12,017
PERSONABLE, THE DIRECTORS LIKE 

5428
03:42:11,851 --> 03:42:13,453
THEM.

5429
03:42:12,084 --> 03:42:15,288
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE 

5430
03:42:13,520 --> 03:42:16,188
DOING, BUT THEY LIKE TO PUT ON 

5431
03:42:15,355 --> 03:42:18,491
AN APPEARANCE.

5432
03:42:16,255 --> 03:42:18,724
THAT'S THE SINGLE BIGGEST 

5433
03:42:18,558 --> 03:42:21,194
DANGER.

5434
03:42:18,791 --> 03:42:24,397
THEN THAT PERSON STAYS AND RUNS 

5435
03:42:21,261 --> 03:42:26,399
IT AND STAYS IN THE TEXTILE OR 

5436
03:42:24,464 --> 03:42:27,567
DEPARTMENT STORE BUSINESS.

5437
03:42:26,466 --> 03:42:30,503
AND IT EXPANDS.

5438
03:42:27,634 --> 03:42:32,338
I LOOKED AT A LOT OF BUSINESSES.

5439
03:42:30,570 --> 03:42:33,239
THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSED THE NUMBER 

5440
03:42:32,405 --> 03:42:35,641
ONE PROBLEM.

5441
03:42:33,306 --> 03:42:37,376
IT ISN'T THE THING THAT THEY 

5442
03:42:35,708 --> 03:42:38,678
LIST BECAUSE THE LAWYERS TELL 

5443
03:42:37,443 --> 03:42:40,846
THEM TO LIST. 

5444
03:42:38,745 --> 03:42:42,782
>> THIS QUESTION IS FOR BOTH 

5445
03:42:40,913 --> 03:42:44,817
WARREN AND CHARLIE.

5446
03:42:42,849 --> 03:42:48,120
NOW THAT THE CRYPTO MARKET 

5447
03:42:44,884 --> 03:42:49,622
OVERALL IS VALUED AT 

5448
03:42:48,187 --> 03:42:52,291
$2 TRILLION, DO YOU STILL C

5449
03:42:49,688 --> 03:42:52,925
CRYPTOS AS WORTHLESS ARTIFICIAL 

5450
03:42:52,358 --> 03:42:54,660
GOLD?

5451
03:42:52,992 --> 03:42:57,497
>> I KNEW THERE WOULD BE A 

5452
03:42:54,727 --> 03:43:00,433
QUESTION ON BITCOIN.

5453
03:42:57,564 --> 03:43:02,635
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, WELL, I'VE 

5454
03:43:00,500 --> 03:43:06,305
WATCHED THESE QUESTIONS DODGE 

5455
03:43:02,702 --> 03:43:08,140
POLITICIANS ALL THE TIME.

5456
03:43:06,372 --> 03:43:13,646
THE TRUTH IS, I'M GOING DODGE 

5457
03:43:08,207 --> 03:43:15,147
THAT QUESTION, BECAUSE WE'VE 

5458
03:43:13,713 --> 03:43:16,516
PROBABLY GOT HUNDREDS OF 

5459
03:43:15,214 --> 03:43:19,118
THOUSAND OF PEOPLE WATCHING THAT

5460
03:43:16,583 --> 03:43:21,487
THAT OWN BITCOIN, AND TWO PEOPLE

5461
03:43:19,185 --> 03:43:25,558
THAT ARE SHORT.

5462
03:43:21,554 --> 03:43:29,695
WE'VE GOT A CHOICE OF MAKING 

5463
03:43:25,625 --> 03:43:31,097
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MAD AT US OR

5464
03:43:29,762 --> 03:43:33,432
MAKING TWO PEOPLE HAPPY.

5465
03:43:31,164 --> 03:43:35,734
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, WE HAD A 

5466
03:43:33,499 --> 03:43:37,203
GOVERNOR ONE TIME IN NEBRASKA, A

5467
03:43:35,801 --> 03:43:38,871
LONG TIME AGO, BUT HE WOULD GET 

5468
03:43:37,270 --> 03:43:40,640
A TOUGH QUESTION -- WHAT DO YOU 

5469
03:43:38,938 --> 03:43:43,075
THINK ABOUT PROPERTY TAXES?

5470
03:43:40,707 --> 03:43:43,643
OR WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT 

5471
03:43:43,142 --> 03:43:45,445
SCHOOLS?

5472
03:43:43,710 --> 03:43:46,846
AND HE'D LOOK RIGHT AT THE 

5473
03:43:45,511 --> 03:43:48,047
PERSON AND SAY, I'M ALL RIGHT ON

5474
03:43:46,913 --> 03:43:49,682
THAT ONE.

5475
03:43:48,114 --> 03:43:51,484
AND HE'D JUST WALK OFF.

5476
03:43:49,749 --> 03:43:57,323
WELL, I'M ALL RIGHT ON THAT ONE.

5477
03:43:51,551 --> 03:44:01,160
WE'LL SEE HOW CHARLIE IS.

5478
03:43:57,390 --> 03:44:03,629
>> WELL, THOSE WHO KNOW ME WELL 

5479
03:44:01,227 --> 03:44:05,798
ARE JUST WAVING THIS RED FLAG AT

5480
03:44:03,696 --> 03:44:10,803
THE BULL.

5481
03:44:05,865 --> 03:44:13,472
OF COURSE I HATE THE BITCOIN 

5482
03:44:10,870 --> 03:44:16,542
SUCCESS, AND I DON'T WELCOME A 

5483
03:44:13,539 --> 03:44:19,345
CURRENCY THAT'S SO USEFUL TO 

5484
03:44:16,609 --> 03:44:19,612
KIDNAPPERS AND EXTORTIONISTS AND

5485
03:44:19,412 --> 03:44:21,680
SO FORTH.

5486
03:44:19,679 --> 03:44:23,249
NOR DO I LIKE SHUFFLING OUT A 

5487
03:44:21,747 --> 03:44:24,850
FEW EXTRA BILLIONS AND BILLIONS 

5488
03:44:23,316 --> 03:44:27,453
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO 

5489
03:44:24,917 --> 03:44:31,224
SOMEBODY WHO JUST INVENTED A NEW

5490
03:44:27,520 --> 03:44:33,125
FINANCIAL PRODUCT OUT OF THIN 

5491
03:44:31,291 --> 03:44:35,928
AIR.

5492
03:44:33,192 --> 03:44:37,129
SO, I THINK I SHOULD SAY 

5493
03:44:35,995 --> 03:44:38,998
MODESTLY THAT THE WHOLE 

5494
03:44:37,196 --> 03:44:39,565
DEVELOPMENT IS DISGUSTING AND 

5495
03:44:39,065 --> 03:44:42,335
CONTRARY TO THE INTEREST OF 

5496
03:44:39,632 --> 03:44:43,002
CIVILIZATION.

5497
03:44:42,402 --> 03:44:45,972
AND I'LL LEAVE THE CRITICISM TO 

5498
03:44:43,069 --> 03:44:53,379
OTHERS.

5499
03:44:46,039 --> 03:44:56,482
>> I'M ALL RIGHT ON THAT ONE.

5500
03:44:53,446 --> 03:44:58,851
>> THE NEXT SERIES OF QUESTIONS 

5501
03:44:56,549 --> 03:45:02,121
ARE FROM JAMES HERNANDEZ.

5502
03:44:58,918 --> 03:45:04,790
HE HAS TWO QUESTIONS.

5503
03:45:02,188 --> 03:45:05,758
ONE FOR AJIT.

5504
03:45:04,857 --> 03:45:08,494
ONE FOR GREG.

5505
03:45:05,825 --> 03:45:11,130
THEY BOTH CONCERN ELON MOSQUE.

5506
03:45:08,561 --> 03:45:12,631
ELON MUSK STATED BERKSHIRE 

5507
03:45:11,197 --> 03:45:14,467
HATHAWAY'S ENERGY PROPOSAL FOR 

5508
03:45:12,698 --> 03:45:15,968
TEXAS IS WRONG.

5509
03:45:14,534 --> 03:45:17,903
INSTEAD, MR. MUSK ARGUES THAT 

5510
03:45:16,035 --> 03:45:20,539
LOAD BALANCING USING BATTERY 

5511
03:45:17,970 --> 03:45:20,940
STORAGE IS THE APPROPRIATE 

5512
03:45:20,606 --> 03:45:22,341
COURSE OF ACTION.

5513
03:45:21,007 --> 03:45:24,410
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THE BHE 

5514
03:45:22,408 --> 03:45:25,678
PROPOSAL IS THE BETTER COURSE OF

5515
03:45:24,476 --> 03:45:27,079
ACTION FOR GOVERNOR ABBOTT IN 

5516
03:45:25,744 --> 03:45:29,148
THE STATE OF TEXAS?

5517
03:45:27,146 --> 03:45:31,083
SPECIFICALLY, WHAT AMOUNT OF 

5518
03:45:29,215 --> 03:45:32,518
SAVINGS CAN THE CITIZENS EXPECT 

5519
03:45:31,150 --> 03:45:33,452
ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT MR. MUSK 

5520
03:45:32,585 --> 03:45:36,489
IS PROPOSING?

5521
03:45:33,519 --> 03:45:37,924
>> SURE.

5522
03:45:36,556 --> 03:45:39,258
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S THE VERY 

5523
03:45:37,991 --> 03:45:42,294
UNFORTUNATE EVENT IN TEXAS IN 

5524
03:45:39,325 --> 03:45:42,561
FEBRUARY AND IT BASICALLY LASTED

5525
03:45:42,361 --> 03:45:43,496
FOUR DAYS.

5526
03:45:42,628 --> 03:45:45,064
MANY LIVES WERE LOST.

5527
03:45:43,563 --> 03:45:45,364
THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE WAS 

5528
03:45:45,131 --> 03:45:46,699
SIGNIFICANT.

5529
03:45:45,431 --> 03:45:52,838
TEXAS HAS HIGHLIGHTED THAT 

5530
03:45:46,766 --> 03:45:54,106
ANYWHERE FROM 80 TO $130 BILLION

5531
03:45:52,905 --> 03:45:55,041
AND INCURRED LOSSES OVER THAT 

5532
03:45:54,173 --> 03:45:57,176
PERIOD OF TIME.

5533
03:45:55,108 --> 03:45:59,712
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 

5534
03:45:57,243 --> 03:46:01,847
POWER SECTOR IT FUNDAMENTALLY 

5535
03:45:59,779 --> 03:46:04,050
LET THE CITIZENS DOWN.

5536
03:46:01,914 --> 03:46:04,417
IT DIDN'T PERFORM AS THEY 

5537
03:46:04,116 --> 03:46:06,386
EXPECTED.

5538
03:46:04,484 --> 03:46:10,690
AND THEN WHEN IT DID PERFORM IT 

5539
03:46:06,452 --> 03:46:12,658
WAS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.

5540
03:46:10,757 --> 03:46:15,728
THEY INCURRED BILLIONS AND 

5541
03:46:12,725 --> 03:46:19,766
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ENERGY 

5542
03:46:15,795 --> 03:46:21,734
COSTS VERSUS A MULTIPLE OF 

5543
03:46:19,832 --> 03:46:22,001
BASICALLY TEN TIMES WHAT THEY 

5544
03:46:21,801 --> 03:46:24,637
PAID.

5545
03:46:22,068 --> 03:46:26,972
THEY PAID TEN TIMES IN ENERGY 

5546
03:46:24,704 --> 03:46:29,075
COSTS OVER THOSE FOUR DAYS WHAT 

5547
03:46:27,039 --> 03:46:32,111
THEY PAID IN THE PAST YEAR.

5548
03:46:29,142 --> 03:46:32,545
SO A VERY SUBSTANTIAL EVENT FOR 

5549
03:46:32,177 --> 03:46:34,180
TEXAS.

5550
03:46:32,612 --> 03:46:36,882
WE'VE GONE TO TEXAS WITH WHAT WE

5551
03:46:34,247 --> 03:46:38,550
BELIEVE IS A GOOD SOLUTION.

5552
03:46:36,949 --> 03:46:42,321
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME PULLING 

5553
03:46:38,617 --> 03:46:44,490
IT TOGETHER, UNDERSTANDING THE 

5554
03:46:42,388 --> 03:46:48,561
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AROUND IT.

5555
03:46:44,557 --> 03:46:49,195
AND OUR PROPOSAL IS BASED ON THE

5556
03:46:48,628 --> 03:46:53,198
FACT THAT THE HEALTH AND WELFARE

5557
03:46:49,262 --> 03:46:57,036
OF TEXANS WERE AT RISK, AND WE 

5558
03:46:53,265 --> 03:46:58,437
NEEDED TO HAVE EFFECTIVELY AN 

5559
03:46:57,103 --> 03:46:58,637
INSURANCE POLICY IN PLACE FOR 

5560
03:46:58,504 --> 03:47:00,439
THEM.

5561
03:46:58,704 --> 03:47:02,408
THAT IF THEY NEEDED TO POWER ON 

5562
03:47:00,506 --> 03:47:04,644
SHORT NOTICE, IT WOULD BE ABLE 

5563
03:47:02,475 --> 03:47:07,046
TO BE DISPATCHED AND IT WOULD BE

5564
03:47:04,711 --> 03:47:10,616
THERE FOR THE FOUR DAYS WE'RE 

5565
03:47:07,113 --> 03:47:11,183
PROPOSING IT COULD BE THERE FOR 

5566
03:47:10,683 --> 03:47:14,486
SEVEN DAYS.

5567
03:47:11,250 --> 03:47:15,755
AND THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT OF 

5568
03:47:14,553 --> 03:47:17,590
OUR PROPOSAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN, IF

5569
03:47:15,822 --> 03:47:18,724
THERE'S A BETTER PROPOSAL THAT'S

5570
03:47:17,657 --> 03:47:20,759
BROUGHT FORWARD, WE'VE 

5571
03:47:18,791 --> 03:47:21,460
ACCOMPLISHED OUR MISSION.

5572
03:47:20,826 --> 03:47:26,365
WE'VE JUST REALLY BEEN THERE 

5573
03:47:21,527 --> 03:47:26,999
TO -- IT'S THE BEST PROPOSAL OR 

5574
03:47:26,432 --> 03:47:28,700
OPTION WE COULD COME UP WITH, 

5575
03:47:27,066 --> 03:47:30,235
AND OBVIOUSLY WITH TEXAS OR ELON

5576
03:47:28,767 --> 03:47:32,204
OR SOMEBODY COMES UP WITH A 

5577
03:47:30,302 --> 03:47:35,374
BETTER PROPOSITION, WE'VE ALWAYS

5578
03:47:32,271 --> 03:47:35,775
SAID, TEXAS, YOU SHOULD PURSUE 

5579
03:47:35,441 --> 03:47:37,343
IT.

5580
03:47:35,842 --> 03:47:40,746
WE STRONGLY BELIEVE RIGHT NOW WE

5581
03:47:37,409 --> 03:47:41,613
HAVE WHAT REMAINS IS A VERY GOOD

5582
03:47:40,812 --> 03:47:44,083
PROPOSAL FOR TEXAS, AND IT WILL 

5583
03:47:41,680 --> 03:47:44,550
CONTINUE TO BE DISCUSSED AND 

5584
03:47:44,150 --> 03:47:46,585
EVALUATED.

5585
03:47:44,617 --> 03:47:49,321
THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A 

5586
03:47:46,652 --> 03:47:53,859
BATTERY PROPOSAL AND OUR 

5587
03:47:49,388 --> 03:47:56,195
PROPOSAL IS THAT WE WILL HAVE 

5588
03:47:53,926 --> 03:47:56,696
POWER THAT CAN BE GENERATED 

5589
03:47:56,262 --> 03:47:57,697
CONTINUOUSLY FOR SEVEN 

5590
03:47:56,762 --> 03:48:01,033
CONSISTENT DAYS.

5591
03:47:57,764 --> 03:48:01,667
WHERE IF YOU WENT TO A BATTERY 

5592
03:48:01,100 --> 03:48:04,904
SOLUTION, YOU MAY RELEASE THAT 

5593
03:48:01,734 --> 03:48:05,804
POWER THAT'S BEEN STORED FOR 

5594
03:48:04,971 --> 03:48:07,372
FOUR HOURS, WITH YOU WE'RE 

5595
03:48:05,871 --> 03:48:08,841
TALKING FOUR DAYS OF A PROBLEM, 

5596
03:48:07,439 --> 03:48:10,676
NOT FOUR HOURS.

5597
03:48:08,908 --> 03:48:13,212
AND IT'S JUST A COMPLETELY 

5598
03:48:10,743 --> 03:48:13,546
DIFFERENT COST EQUATION AND 

5599
03:48:13,279 --> 03:48:15,914
SOLUTION.

5600
03:48:13,613 --> 03:48:17,750
SO VERY PROUD THAT OUR TEAM'S 

5601
03:48:15,981 --> 03:48:19,585
BROUGHT FORWARD WHAT I THOUGHT 

5602
03:48:17,817 --> 03:48:25,224
WAS A VERY UNIQUE SOLUTION.

5603
03:48:19,652 --> 03:48:26,192
WE WORKED HARD WITH OUR SU

5604
03:48:25,291 --> 03:48:28,394
SUPPLIERS AND PUT TOGETHER WHAT 

5605
03:48:26,259 --> 03:48:30,529
WE BELIEVE IS A FIRM COST THAT 

5606
03:48:28,461 --> 03:48:32,031
CAN ALSO BE DELIVERED BY 

5607
03:48:30,596 --> 03:48:35,367
NOVEMBER OF '23.

5608
03:48:32,098 --> 03:48:35,567
SO AGAIN WE PUT A FIRM DATE ON 

5609
03:48:35,434 --> 03:48:39,271
IT.

5610
03:48:35,634 --> 03:48:39,605
IT WON'T BE READY NEXT WINTER, 

5611
03:48:39,338 --> 03:48:41,039
UNFORTUNATELY.

5612
03:48:39,671 --> 03:48:42,675
WON'T BE READY THIS SUMMER BUT 

5613
03:48:41,106 --> 03:48:45,945
IT'S A VALUABLE SOLUTION AND ONE

5614
03:48:42,742 --> 03:48:46,945
THAT WE HOPE AT LEAST LEADS TO 

5615
03:48:46,011 --> 03:48:47,780
THE RIGHT DISCUSSION AND THE 

5616
03:48:47,012 --> 03:48:48,380
RIGHT LONG-TERM DISCUSSION FOR 

5617
03:48:47,847 --> 03:48:49,582
THE STATE.

5618
03:48:48,447 --> 03:48:52,484
>> YEAH, AND WE'RE ALSO WILLING 

5619
03:48:49,648 --> 03:48:55,020
TO PUT UP $4 BILLION THAT IF WE 

5620
03:48:52,551 --> 03:48:57,289
DON'T DELIVER WHEN WE SAY WE'RE 

5621
03:48:55,087 --> 03:49:02,628
GOING TO DELIVER, WE'LL PAY IT 

5622
03:48:57,356 --> 03:49:05,430
AS A PENALTY, BASICALLY.

5623
03:49:02,695 --> 03:49:07,333
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WENT TO 

5624
03:49:05,497 --> 03:49:10,803
GENERAL ELECTRIC, SAID, HOW LONG

5625
03:49:07,400 --> 03:49:12,971
COULD WE GET TURBINES.

5626
03:49:10,870 --> 03:49:16,342
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE 

5627
03:49:13,038 --> 03:49:18,811
PREPARED FOR 2023, YOU HAVE TO 

5628
03:49:16,409 --> 03:49:22,882
START AT A POINT FAIRLY SOON, 

5629
03:49:18,878 --> 03:49:25,317
AND YOU HAVE INFLATION GOING ON,

5630
03:49:22,949 --> 03:49:27,052
AND KEY WAS NOT GOING THE CHANGE

5631
03:49:25,384 --> 03:49:28,720
THINGS IN A MONTH.

5632
03:49:27,119 --> 03:49:29,721
THEY HAD 100 PEOPLE WORKING ON 

5633
03:49:28,787 --> 03:49:31,490
IT OR SOMETHING. 

5634
03:49:29,788 --> 03:49:32,358
>> YEAH, THEY HAD HUNDREDS 

5635
03:49:31,557 --> 03:49:34,493
WORKING ON IT. 

5636
03:49:32,424 --> 03:49:35,727
>> AND GE IS COOPERATIVE.

5637
03:49:34,560 --> 03:49:37,696
BUT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE THE 

5638
03:49:35,794 --> 03:49:38,296
BEST SOLUTION.

5639
03:49:37,763 --> 03:49:40,432
WE JUST KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO.

5640
03:49:38,363 --> 03:49:42,335
IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT FASTER, 

5641
03:49:40,499 --> 03:49:45,037
THEY CAN DO IT CHEAPER, 

5642
03:49:42,401 --> 03:49:48,006
WHATEVER, THAT'S TERRIFIC.

5643
03:49:45,104 --> 03:49:50,710
BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING 

5644
03:49:48,073 --> 03:49:52,912
TO LOSE TIF THEY DON'T DO IT.

5645
03:49:50,776 --> 03:49:54,479
AND WE'LL BACK OUR PROMISE UP BY

5646
03:49:52,979 --> 03:49:57,183
$4 BILLION, AND WE WON'T HAVE 

5647
03:49:54,546 --> 03:49:59,385
ANY RINKY DINK CLAUSES IN THERE 

5648
03:49:57,249 --> 03:50:00,886
THAT IF THIS HAPPENSER THAT 

5649
03:49:59,452 --> 03:50:02,855
HAPPENS, WE WON'T PAYMENT BUT WE

5650
03:50:00,953 --> 03:50:03,455
WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT AIER 

5651
03:50:02,922 --> 03:50:06,091
FROM NOW.

5652
03:50:03,522 --> 03:50:07,759
WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT A YEAR 

5653
03:50:06,158 --> 03:50:09,595
FROM NOW WITH THE COSTS WHAT 

5654
03:50:07,826 --> 03:50:11,497
THEY ARE THEN.

5655
03:50:09,662 --> 03:50:11,797
TEXAS IS A TERRIFIC PLACE TO DO 

5656
03:50:11,563 --> 03:50:14,800
BUSINESS.

5657
03:50:11,864 --> 03:50:18,437
WE DO A LOT OF BUSINESS THERE.

5658
03:50:14,867 --> 03:50:21,340
IT'S A GREAT PLACE.

5659
03:50:18,504 --> 03:50:25,177
AND THIS WAS OUT OF THE BLUE, 

5660
03:50:21,407 --> 03:50:28,213
BUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER -- THE 

5661
03:50:25,244 --> 03:50:31,150
NATURE OF UTILITY BUSINESS IS 

5662
03:50:28,280 --> 03:50:32,417
THAT YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR

5663
03:50:31,217 --> 03:50:33,219
SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY ISN'T 

5664
03:50:32,484 --> 03:50:36,822
GOING TO HAPPEN.

5665
03:50:33,286 --> 03:50:38,056
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY,

5666
03:50:36,889 --> 03:50:40,726
IT'S A 1 IN 30 YEAR EVENT AND 

5667
03:50:38,123 --> 03:50:42,561
PEOPLE DIE.

5668
03:50:40,793 --> 03:50:45,464
SO, YOU WANT A MARGIN OF SAFETY 

5669
03:50:42,628 --> 03:50:47,032
IN IT, AND WE'VE GOT ONE 

5670
03:50:45,531 --> 03:50:50,969
SOLUTION, AND OTHER PEOPLE MAY 

5671
03:50:47,099 --> 03:50:52,671
HAVE OTHER SOLUTIONS, AND WE 

5672
03:50:51,036 --> 03:50:54,139
WILL CHEER WHEN A SOLUTION IS 

5673
03:50:52,738 --> 03:50:56,174
REACHED OF ANY KIND, AND WE'LL 

5674
03:50:54,206 --> 03:50:56,374
CHEER A LITTLE LOUDER IF IT'S 

5675
03:50:56,241 --> 03:50:59,044
OURS.

5676
03:50:56,441 --> 03:51:00,946
>> AJIT, YOUR QUESTION FROM THIS

5677
03:50:59,111 --> 03:51:02,948
GENTLEMAN -- SUPPOSE THE 

5678
03:51:01,013 --> 03:51:05,518
HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION ARISES 

5679
03:51:03,015 --> 03:51:09,288
WHERE WARREN BUFFET CALLS YOU ON

5680
03:51:05,584 --> 03:51:10,355
THE PHONE TO TELL YOU ELON MUSK 

5681
03:51:09,355 --> 03:51:12,324
HAS CONTACTED HIM TO WRITE AN 

5682
03:51:10,422 --> 03:51:14,260
INSURANCE POLICY ON HIS PROPOSED

5683
03:51:12,391 --> 03:51:19,398
COME ANIZATION OF MARCH.

5684
03:51:14,327 --> 03:51:24,703
SPECIFICALLY TO ENSURE A SPACEX 

5685
03:51:19,465 --> 03:51:24,903
CAPSULE AND ANY HUMAN LOAD ON 

5686
03:51:24,770 --> 03:51:26,505
BOARD.

5687
03:51:24,970 --> 03:51:27,907
WOULD YOU WRITE ON THAT?

5688
03:51:26,572 --> 03:51:29,908
>> THIS IS AN EASY ONE.

5689
03:51:27,974 --> 03:51:30,208
NO THANK YOU.

5690
03:51:29,975 --> 03:51:32,912
I'LL PASS. 

5691
03:51:30,275 --> 03:51:33,145
>> I WAS ABLE TO DEPEND ON THE 

5692
03:51:32,978 --> 03:51:35,481
PREMIUM.

5693
03:51:33,212 --> 03:51:37,383
I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A SOMEWHAT

5694
03:51:35,548 --> 03:51:38,784
DIFFERENT RATE IF ELON WAS ON 

5695
03:51:37,450 --> 03:51:40,586
BOARD OR NOT ON BOARD.

5696
03:51:38,851 --> 03:51:43,389
NO, IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

5697
03:51:40,653 --> 03:51:45,224
IF SOMEBODY'S ASKING YOU TO 

5698
03:51:43,456 --> 03:51:45,858
ENSURE SOMETHING -- SO I 

5699
03:51:45,290 --> 03:51:50,596
WOULD -- THAT'S CALLED GETTING 

5700
03:51:45,924 --> 03:51:52,631
SKIN IN THE GAME.

5701
03:51:50,663 --> 03:51:54,366
>> BUT IN GENERAL I WOULD BE 

5702
03:51:52,698 --> 03:51:55,034
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WRITING AN 

5703
03:51:54,433 --> 03:52:04,843
INSURANCE POLICY WHERE ELON MUSK

5704
03:51:55,100 --> 03:52:06,779
IS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

5705
03:52:04,910 --> 03:52:08,247
>> TELL HIM HE WANTED TO CALL ME

5706
03:52:06,846 --> 03:52:10,849
INSTEAD OF AJIT. 

5707
03:52:08,314 --> 03:52:12,985
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM 

5708
03:52:10,916 --> 03:52:14,820
MICHAEL LU FROM CALIFORNIA.

5709
03:52:13,052 --> 03:52:16,555
THIS IS FOR WARREN AND CHARLIE.

5710
03:52:14,887 --> 03:52:18,190
THE YOUR SHAREHOLDER LETTER YOU 

5711
03:52:16,622 --> 03:52:20,158
MENTION THE BEST RESULTS COME 

5712
03:52:18,257 --> 03:52:22,494
FROM COMPANIES THAT REQUIRE 

5713
03:52:20,225 --> 03:52:24,830
MINIMUM ASSETS TO CONDUCT HIGH 

5714
03:52:22,561 --> 03:52:27,766
MARGIN BUSINESSES TODAY AS WORLD

5715
03:52:24,897 --> 03:52:28,434
THESE DEPEND TO BE SOFTWARE 

5716
03:52:27,833 --> 03:52:31,137
BUSINESSES.

5717
03:52:28,501 --> 03:52:34,439
WHILE BERKSHIRE AVOIDED THOSE IN

5718
03:52:31,203 --> 03:52:35,073
THE PAST THAT SEEMS TO BE 

5719
03:52:34,506 --> 03:52:36,075
CHANGING WITH YOUR INVESTMENTS 

5720
03:52:35,140 --> 03:52:38,310
IN APP AND SNOWFLAKE.

5721
03:52:36,142 --> 03:52:39,978
AS SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD WE EXPECT

5722
03:52:38,377 --> 03:52:43,282
HIGH MARGIN BUSINESSES WILL 

5723
03:52:40,045 --> 03:52:45,951
CONSTITUTE A LARGER PORTION OF 

5724
03:52:43,349 --> 03:52:48,820
BERKSHIRE'S PORTFOLIO OVER TIME,

5725
03:52:46,018 --> 03:52:50,723
PARTICULARLY AS TOM AND TED TAKE

5726
03:52:48,887 --> 03:52:52,624
OVER ROLES IN THE PROCESS?

5727
03:52:50,789 --> 03:52:54,192
>> WELL, WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THE 

5728
03:52:52,691 --> 03:52:56,695
GREEN BUSINESS IS THE ONE THAT 

5729
03:52:54,259 --> 03:52:56,862
TAKES LITTLE CAPITAL AND GROWS A

5730
03:52:56,762 --> 03:52:59,031
LOT.

5731
03:52:56,928 --> 03:53:00,499
AND APPLE AND GOOGLE AND 

5732
03:52:59,098 --> 03:53:02,368
MICROSOFT AND FACEBOOK ARE 

5733
03:53:00,566 --> 03:53:08,040
TERRIFIC EXAMPLES OF THAT.

5734
03:53:02,435 --> 03:53:09,108
I MEAN, APPLE HAS $37 BILLION IN

5735
03:53:08,107 --> 03:53:10,910
POVERTY PLANNED EQUIPMENT.

5736
03:53:09,175 --> 03:53:11,643
BERKSHIRE HAS $170 BILLION OR 

5737
03:53:10,976 --> 03:53:13,078
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

5738
03:53:11,710 --> 03:53:13,846
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE MORE MONEY

5739
03:53:13,145 --> 03:53:17,749
THAN WE DO.

5740
03:53:13,913 --> 03:53:17,983
IT'S A MUCH BETTER BUSINESS THAN

5741
03:53:17,816 --> 03:53:19,618
WE HAVE.

5742
03:53:18,049 --> 03:53:20,285
AND MICHAEL AS BUSINESS IS A 

5743
03:53:19,685 --> 03:53:22,654
BETTER BUSINESS.

5744
03:53:20,352 --> 03:53:24,056
GOOGLE AS BUSINESS IS BETTER.

5745
03:53:22,721 --> 03:53:25,557
WE'VE ALWAYS LOOKED -- WE'VE 

5746
03:53:24,123 --> 03:53:28,493
KNOWN THAT A LONG TIME.

5747
03:53:25,624 --> 03:53:30,596
WE FOUND THAT OUT WITH SEE'S 

5748
03:53:28,560 --> 03:53:31,630
CANDY IN 1972.

5749
03:53:30,663 --> 03:53:34,099
IT JUST DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT 

5750
03:53:31,697 --> 03:53:34,800
MUCH CAPITAL.

5751
03:53:34,166 --> 03:53:36,568
IT DOESN'T HAVE -- IT HAS 

5752
03:53:34,867 --> 03:53:38,571
OBVIOUSLY A COUPLE OF 

5753
03:53:36,635 --> 03:53:40,939
MANUFACTURING PLANTS, THEY CALL 

5754
03:53:38,637 --> 03:53:45,510
THEM KITCHENS.

5755
03:53:41,006 --> 03:53:46,645
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A BIG 

5756
03:53:45,577 --> 03:53:47,346
INVENTORY EXCEPT SEASONALLY FOR 

5757
03:53:46,712 --> 03:53:49,047
A SHORT PERIOD.

5758
03:53:47,412 --> 03:53:49,381
DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF 

5759
03:53:49,114 --> 03:53:53,018
RECEIVABLES.

5760
03:53:49,448 --> 03:53:54,219
THOSE ARE THE KIND OF 

5761
03:53:53,085 --> 03:53:58,457
BUSINESS -- THEY'RE THE BEST 

5762
03:53:54,286 --> 03:53:58,690
BUSINESSES BUT COMMAND THE BEST 

5763
03:53:58,523 --> 03:54:00,292
PRICES.

5764
03:53:58,757 --> 03:54:02,661
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THEM ALL THE 

5765
03:54:00,359 --> 03:54:04,463
TIME, AND WE'VE GOT A FEW THAT 

5766
03:54:02,728 --> 03:54:05,697
ARE PRETTY DARN GOOD, BUT WE 

5767
03:54:04,530 --> 03:54:06,632
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AS BIG AS 

5768
03:54:05,764 --> 03:54:13,672
THE BIG GUYS.

5769
03:54:06,699 --> 03:54:15,508
BUT THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY'S 

5770
03:54:13,739 --> 03:54:16,142
LOOKING FOR.

5771
03:54:15,574 --> 03:54:16,776
THAT'S WHAT CAPITALISM IS ABOUT,

5772
03:54:16,208 --> 03:54:17,476
PEOPLE GETS A RETURN ON CAPITAL.

5773
03:54:16,842 --> 03:54:18,177
AND THE WAY YOU GET IT IS HAVING

5774
03:54:17,543 --> 03:54:18,511
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T TAKE TOO 

5775
03:54:18,244 --> 03:54:20,579
MUCH CAPITAL.

5776
03:54:18,577 --> 03:54:22,547
I MEAN, IF YOU HAVE TO REALLY 

5777
03:54:20,645 --> 03:54:24,550
PUT OUT TONS AND TONS OF 

5778
03:54:22,614 --> 03:54:26,752
CAPITAL -- THE UTILITY BUSINESS,

5779
03:54:24,617 --> 03:54:27,019
IT'S NOT A SUPER HIGH RETURN 

5780
03:54:26,819 --> 03:54:28,453
BUSINESS.

5781
03:54:27,086 --> 03:54:29,021
YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT OUT A LOT 

5782
03:54:28,520 --> 03:54:30,989
OF CAPITAL.

5783
03:54:29,088 --> 03:54:32,624
YOU GET A RETURN ON THE CAPITAL,

5784
03:54:31,056 --> 03:54:33,125
BUT YOU DON'T GET FABULOUS 

5785
03:54:32,691 --> 03:54:34,726
RETURN.

5786
03:54:33,192 --> 03:54:35,961
YOU DON'T GET GOOGLE LIKE 

5787
03:54:34,793 --> 03:54:37,463
RETURNS OR ANYTHING REMOTELY 

5788
03:54:36,028 --> 03:54:41,333
CLOSE TO IT.

5789
03:54:37,530 --> 03:54:44,603
YOU KNOW, WE'RE PROPOSING A 

5790
03:54:41,400 --> 03:54:46,004
RETURN IN THE TRANSACTION WITH 

5791
03:54:44,670 --> 03:54:47,839
THE PROPOSITION WITH TEXAS.

5792
03:54:46,071 --> 03:54:50,375
I THINK IT'S 9.3%. 

5793
03:54:47,906 --> 03:54:51,977
>> YEAH, 9.3%. 

5794
03:54:50,442 --> 03:54:53,945
>> YEAH, AND THAT -- BUT IF YOU 

5795
03:54:52,044 --> 03:54:56,214
LOOK AT THE RETURN ON MOST 

5796
03:54:54,012 --> 03:54:57,682
AMERICAN BUSINESSES, NET 

5797
03:54:56,281 --> 03:55:01,487
TANGIBLE ASSETS IT'S A LOT 

5798
03:54:57,749 --> 03:55:03,388
HIGHER THAN 9.3, BUT THEY AREN'T

5799
03:55:01,554 --> 03:55:04,923
UTILITY BUSINESSES, EITHER. 

5800
03:55:03,455 --> 03:55:06,225
>> CHARLIE, DID YOU WANT TO ADD 

5801
03:55:04,990 --> 03:55:06,892
ANYTHING TO THAT?

5802
03:55:06,292 --> 03:55:11,263
>> NO. 

5803
03:55:06,958 --> 03:55:15,700
>> THIS QUESTION IS FROM RYAN 

5804
03:55:11,330 --> 03:55:18,637

GIVEN THEIR -- TO THE FIRM, CAN 

5815
03:55:37,923 --> 03:55:41,526
YOU DISCUSS THIS POLICY AND 

5816
03:55:39,525 --> 03:55:43,094
WHETHER WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM 

5817
03:55:41,593 --> 03:55:44,930
THEM MORE IN THE COMING YEARS?

5818
03:55:43,161 --> 03:55:48,400
>> THEY'RE BOTH ABSOLUTELY 

5819
03:55:44,997 --> 03:55:49,401
TERRIFIC, AND THAT'S ONE REASON 

5820
03:55:48,467 --> 03:55:50,536
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE QUIZZING 

5821
03:55:49,467 --> 03:55:52,938
THEM ON STOCKS.

5822
03:55:50,602 --> 03:55:54,572
THEY'RE ASSETS OF BERKSHIRE.

5823
03:55:53,005 --> 03:55:56,841
THERE'S NO REASON FOR THEM TO BE

5824
03:55:54,639 --> 03:56:00,980
OUT EDUCATING OTHER PEOPLE ON 

5825
03:55:56,908 --> 03:56:03,148
HOW TO COMPETE WITH US.

5826
03:56:01,046 --> 03:56:06,685
IT WOULDN'T -- IT ALWAYS SEEMS 

5827
03:56:03,215 --> 03:56:09,821
SO SILLY THAT PEOPLE EXPECT -- 

5828
03:56:06,751 --> 03:56:11,690
THEY DON'T EXPECT MERCK OR 

5829
03:56:09,888 --> 03:56:13,325
PFIZER TO TELL THEM THE EXACT 

5830
03:56:11,757 --> 03:56:16,161
SCIENCE THEY'RE WORKING ON.

5831
03:56:13,391 --> 03:56:20,499
THE FAILURES, ELIMINATE THOSE.

5832
03:56:16,228 --> 03:56:23,101
AND YOU KNOW, THE -- IF YOU'VE 

5833
03:56:20,565 --> 03:56:24,803
GOT TALENT THAT KNOWS HOW TO 

5834
03:56:23,168 --> 03:56:27,339
EVALUATE BUSINESSES -- AND THOSE

5835
03:56:24,870 --> 03:56:27,639
TWO FELLAS HAVE GONE FAR BEYOND 

5836
03:56:27,406 --> 03:56:30,775
THAT.

5837
03:56:27,706 --> 03:56:33,011
THEY'RE TERRIFIC ASSETS, AND 

5838
03:56:30,842 --> 03:56:34,212
THEY LOVE BERKSHIRE AND WORK 

5839
03:56:33,078 --> 03:56:36,181
EXTRAORDINARY HOURS.

5840
03:56:34,279 --> 03:56:37,349
BUT WE DON'T REALLY WANT THEM 

5841
03:56:36,248 --> 03:56:40,952
GOING AROUND WITH PEOPLE ASKING 

5842
03:56:37,416 --> 03:56:41,820
THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY YOU 

5843
03:56:41,019 --> 03:56:44,256
LIKE THIS INDUSTRY BETTER OR 

5844
03:56:41,887 --> 03:56:46,692
ANYTHING OF THE SORT.

5845
03:56:44,323 --> 03:56:49,928
>> THIS QUESTION'S FOR CHARLIE.

5846
03:56:46,759 --> 03:56:50,161
IT COMES FROM STEVEN TENOR IN 

5847
03:56:49,994 --> 03:56:51,763
ATLANTA.

5848
03:56:50,228 --> 03:56:52,797
HE'S BEEN A BERKSHIRE 

5849
03:56:51,830 --> 03:57:00,572
SHAREHOLDER FOR TEN YEARS AND 

5850
03:56:52,864 --> 03:57:02,507
SAYS YOU AND YOUR FRIEND LEELU 

5851
03:57:00,639 --> 03:57:04,009
HAVE BEEN -- SINCE ITS INITIAL 

5852
03:57:02,574 --> 03:57:06,778
PURCHASE IN 2008.

5853
03:57:04,076 --> 03:57:07,445
IT'S CURRENTLY VALUE AT 

5854
03:57:06,845 --> 03:57:10,849
$5.3 BILLION.

5855
03:57:07,512 --> 03:57:13,251
THE DAILY JOURNAL RECENTLY 

5856
03:57:10,916 --> 03:57:16,354
BOUGHT A LARGE SHARE OF ALIBABA 

5857
03:57:13,318 --> 03:57:17,889
AFTER JACK MA WAS -- AND HIS 

5858
03:57:16,421 --> 03:57:18,991
OTHER WAS NOT ALLOWED TO PREEZ 

5859
03:57:17,956 --> 03:57:20,558
WITH IPO.

5860
03:57:19,058 --> 03:57:27,732
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON CHINA 

5861
03:57:20,625 --> 03:57:29,200
AND WHETHER BUSINESSES -- THE 

5862
03:57:27,799 --> 03:57:31,336
GOVERNMENT WILL LET BUSINESSES 

5863
03:57:29,267 --> 03:57:32,638
WITH STRONG LEADERS TO FLOURISH 

5864
03:57:31,403 --> 03:57:35,874
IN THE YEARS TO COME?

5865
03:57:32,705 --> 03:57:37,242
>> I THINK THE CHINESE 

5866
03:57:35,941 --> 03:57:38,076
GOVERNMENT WILL ALLOW BUSINESSES

5867
03:57:37,309 --> 03:57:39,244
TO FLOURISH.

5868
03:57:38,143 --> 03:57:40,812
IT'S THE BEST THING THAT 

5869
03:57:39,311 --> 03:57:43,248
HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF THE 

5870
03:57:40,879 --> 03:57:44,916
WORLD WHEN A BUNCH OF COMMITTED 

5871
03:57:43,315 --> 03:57:46,384
COMMUNISTS LOOKED AT THE 

5872
03:57:44,983 --> 03:57:47,886
PROSPERITY OF PLACES LIKE 

5873
03:57:46,451 --> 03:57:48,620
SINGAPORE AND SAID, THE HELL 

5874
03:57:47,953 --> 03:57:50,255
WITH THIS.

5875
03:57:48,687 --> 03:57:51,290
WE'RE NOT GOING STAY HERE IN 

5876
03:57:50,322 --> 03:57:54,593
POWER.

5877
03:57:51,357 --> 03:57:56,361
WE'RE GOING TO COPY WHAT WORKS.

5878
03:57:54,660 --> 03:57:57,796
THEY CHANGED COMMUNISM.

5879
03:57:56,428 --> 03:57:59,964
THEY ACCEPTED ADAM SMITH AND 

5880
03:57:57,863 --> 03:58:02,101
ADDED IT TO COMMUNISM.

5881
03:58:00,031 --> 03:58:03,602
AND NOW WE HAVE COMMUNISM WITH 

5882
03:58:02,167 --> 03:58:06,237
CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS.

5883
03:58:03,669 --> 03:58:07,639
CHINA WITH A FREE MARKET WITH A 

5884
03:58:06,304 --> 03:58:10,141
BUNCH OF BILLIONAIRES.

5885
03:58:07,706 --> 03:58:12,077
AND THEY MADE THAT SHIFT.

5886
03:58:10,208 --> 03:58:12,444
AND THEY DESERVE A LOT OF 

5887
03:58:12,144 --> 03:58:15,380
CREDIT.

5888
03:58:12,511 --> 03:58:17,482
WARREN AND I ARE NOT QUITE AS 

5889
03:58:15,447 --> 03:58:20,919
GOOD AT THAT, CHANGES OUR MINDS 

5890
03:58:17,549 --> 03:58:21,786
IN MANY CASES, AND THAT WAS A 

5891
03:58:20,986 --> 03:58:23,388
REMARKABLE CHANGE COMING FROM 

5892
03:58:21,853 --> 03:58:26,525
SUCH A PLACE, AND OF COURSE IT'S

5893
03:58:23,455 --> 03:58:29,461
WORKED LIKE GANGBUSTERS.

5894
03:58:26,592 --> 03:58:32,030
THAT IS ENORMOUS GROWTH, THE 

5895
03:58:29,528 --> 03:58:32,297
AVERAGE INCOME OF THE ARCH 

5896
03:58:32,097 --> 03:58:34,198
CHINESE.

5897
03:58:32,364 --> 03:58:36,735
THEY'VE LIFTED 800 MILLION 

5898
03:58:34,265 --> 03:58:37,969
PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY, FAST.

5899
03:58:36,802 --> 03:58:41,573
AND THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING 

5900
03:58:38,036 --> 03:58:42,841
LIKE IT IN THE HISTORY OF THE 

5901
03:58:41,640 --> 03:58:43,842
WORLD, SO MY HAT IS OFF TO THE 

5902
03:58:42,908 --> 03:58:45,077
CHINESE, AND I THINK THEY WILL 

5903
03:58:43,909 --> 03:58:45,277
CONTINUE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MAKE

5904
03:58:45,144 --> 03:58:46,812
MONEY.

5905
03:58:45,344 --> 03:58:48,713
THEY LEARNED IT WORKS.

5906
03:58:46,879 --> 03:58:49,815
I LOVE WHAT THE GUY SAID IN THE 

5907
03:58:48,780 --> 03:58:51,817
FIRST PLACE -- I DON'T CARE 

5908
03:58:49,882 --> 03:58:53,685
WHETHER THE CAT IS BLACK AND 

5909
03:58:51,884 --> 03:58:53,885
WHITE, AS LONG AS IT CATCHES 

5910
03:58:53,752 --> 03:58:57,823
MICE.

5911
03:58:53,952 --> 03:59:00,325
THAT'S MY KIND OF TALK.

5912
03:58:57,890 --> 03:59:02,194
>> IN THAT LIST OF THE MOST 

5913
03:59:00,392 --> 03:59:02,427
VALUABLE COMPANIES, THREE ARE 

5914
03:59:02,261 --> 03:59:04,596
CHINESE.

5915
03:59:02,494 --> 03:59:07,599
IF YOU'RE LOOKING OUT 30 YEARS, 

5916
03:59:04,663 --> 03:59:08,200
MY GUESS IS MORE.

5917
03:59:07,666 --> 03:59:10,035
BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL TOP 

5918
03:59:08,266 --> 03:59:13,705
THE UNITED STATES.

5919
03:59:10,102 --> 03:59:17,209
BUT WHO KNOWS.

5920
03:59:13,772 --> 03:59:18,276
IT'S -- IT'S AMAZING WHAT HAS 

5921
03:59:17,276 --> 03:59:19,711
BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. 

5922
03:59:18,343 --> 03:59:22,247
>> YEAH, REALLY AMAZING. 

5923
03:59:19,777 --> 03:59:23,415
>> AND THEY FOUND WHAT WORKS.

5924
03:59:22,314 --> 03:59:26,551
NOTHING LIKE FINDING SOMETHING 

5925
03:59:23,482 --> 03:59:27,886
THAT WORKS IN ORDER TO 

5926
03:59:26,618 --> 03:59:29,388
REINFOREIN

5927
03:59:27,952 --> 03:59:31,056
REINFORCED IDEAS OVER TIME.

5928
03:59:29,455 --> 03:59:33,792
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

5929
03:59:31,123 --> 03:59:34,459
I WILL BET THERE WILL BE MORE 

5930
03:59:33,858 --> 03:59:35,193
THAN THREE, BUT I'LL BET THE 

5931
03:59:34,526 --> 03:59:36,194
UNITED STATES HAS MORE THAN 

5932
03:59:35,259 --> 03:59:38,797
CHINA HAS, TOO. 

5933
03:59:36,261 --> 03:59:42,067
>> THIS ONE COMES FROM TIM 

5934
03:59:38,864 --> 03:59:44,236
MEDLEY IN JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI, 

5935
03:59:42,134 --> 03:59:44,436
WHO'S BEEN A SHAREHOLDER SINCE 

5936
03:59:44,303 --> 03:59:46,504
1997.

5937
03:59:44,503 --> 03:59:48,974
HE WRITES ON MARCH 19th, THE 

5938
03:59:46,571 --> 03:59:51,943
FORMER PRESIDENT OF HARVARD 

5939
03:59:49,041 --> 03:59:52,911
UNIVERSITY, LARRY SUMMERS WAS 

5940
03:59:52,010 --> 03:59:55,380
CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT 

5941
03:59:52,978 --> 03:59:56,414
JOE BIDEN'S $1.9 TRILLION 

5942
03:59:55,447 --> 03:59:59,050
AMERICAN RESCUE STIMULUS PLAN, 

5943
03:59:56,481 --> 04:00:00,252
AND IN AN INTERVIEW BE BLOOMBERG

5944
03:59:59,117 --> 04:00:03,154
TELEVISION SAID, I'M WORRIED 

5945
04:00:00,318 --> 04:00:04,857
WE'LL HAVE MORE INFLATION OR A 

5946
04:00:03,221 --> 04:00:05,724
DRAMATIC FISCAL, MONETARY 

5947
04:00:04,923 --> 04:00:08,059
COLLISION.

5948
04:00:05,791 --> 04:00:08,326
THIS GOES WAY BEYOND WHAT IS 

5949
04:00:08,126 --> 04:00:11,396
NECESSARY.

5950
04:00:08,393 --> 04:00:12,831
HE SAID, ALSO, THIS IS THE LEAST

5951
04:00:11,463 --> 04:00:14,366
RESPONSIBLE MACROECONOMIC POLICY

5952
04:00:12,898 --> 04:00:14,900
WE HAVE HAD IN THE LAST 40 

5953
04:00:14,433 --> 04:00:15,734
YEARS.

5954
04:00:14,967 --> 04:00:17,870
YOUR THOUGHTS?

5955
04:00:15,800 --> 04:00:21,272
>> YOU'RE ASKING ME ON THAT. 

5956
04:00:17,936 --> 04:00:22,040
>> HE DIDN'T WRITE TO WHO, SO 

5957
04:00:21,339 --> 04:00:23,975
ANYBODY ON THE STAGE. 

5958
04:00:22,107 --> 04:00:27,479
>> I WOULD SAY LARRY'S BEEN 

5959
04:00:24,042 --> 04:00:30,715
READING HIS UNCLE'S BOOK.

5960
04:00:27,546 --> 04:00:36,254
LARRY IS A VERY, VERY SMART -- 

5961
04:00:30,782 --> 04:00:38,824
ALTHOUGH AND HE'S LETTING OUT 

5962
04:00:36,321 --> 04:00:40,892
POSSIBILITIES WHICH ACTUALLY NOW

5963
04:00:38,891 --> 04:00:46,832
VOICED A LITTLE BIT MORE SINCE 

5964
04:00:40,959 --> 04:00:50,268
THAT MARCH 19th -- WHATEVER DATE

5965
04:00:46,899 --> 04:00:54,673
IT WAS THAT THEY MADE THAT -- 

5966
04:00:50,335 --> 04:00:58,843
YOU CAN'T JUST DO ONE THING IN 

5967
04:00:54,739 --> 04:01:02,480
ECONOMICS, AND IF WE REALLY 

5968
04:00:58,910 --> 04:01:04,049
COULD SHOVEL OUT MORE AND MORE 

5969
04:01:02,547 --> 04:01:06,217
DEBT AND THE COST TURNED OUT TO 

5970
04:01:04,115 --> 04:01:09,488
BE LOW -- PEOPLE THOUGHT JAPAN 

5971
04:01:06,284 --> 04:01:11,756
COULDN'T DO WHAT THEY'VE DONE, 

5972
04:01:09,555 --> 04:01:15,127
BUT, YOU KNOW, USED TO BE CALLED

5973
04:01:11,823 --> 04:01:18,363
THE WIDOWMAKER AROUND SOLOMON, 

5974
04:01:15,193 --> 04:01:22,367
AND PEOPLE WERE SHORTING 

5975
04:01:18,430 --> 04:01:26,471
JAPANESE BONDS.

5976
04:01:22,434 --> 04:01:26,938
BUT THE ANSWER IS, WE DON'T 

5977
04:01:26,538 --> 04:01:29,508
KNOW.

5978
04:01:27,005 --> 04:01:33,078
BUT LARRY'S VIEW IS AN IMPORTANT

5979
04:01:29,575 --> 04:01:35,446
VIEW, AND IT'S JUST AS GOOD AS, 

5980
04:01:33,145 --> 04:01:36,147
IF MY -- THE VIEW ON THE OTHER 

5981
04:01:35,513 --> 04:01:38,350
SIDE MIGHT BE.

5982
04:01:36,214 --> 04:01:40,852
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS FROM 

5983
04:01:38,416 --> 04:01:43,855
THE PRESENT POLICIES.

5984
04:01:40,919 --> 04:01:45,356
WE DO KNOW, AS JAY POWELL SAID 

5985
04:01:43,922 --> 04:01:48,793
THE OTHER DAY, THAT THE IDEA 

5986
04:01:45,423 --> 04:01:52,730
THAT 100% OF GDP WAS SOME 

5987
04:01:48,860 --> 04:01:54,566
TERRIBLY DANGEROUS LEVEL, IN 

5988
04:01:52,797 --> 04:01:56,768
TERMS OF DEBT, THAT DOESN'T 

5989
04:01:54,633 --> 04:02:00,438
REALLY MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE

5990
04:01:56,835 --> 04:02:00,805
NOW, AND THAT USED TO BE KIND OF

5991
04:02:00,505 --> 04:02:03,108
ACCEPTED WISDOM.

5992
04:02:00,872 --> 04:02:05,544
WE'VE LEARNED A LOT OF THINGS WE

5993
04:02:03,175 --> 04:02:07,078
THOUGHT BEFORE WEREN'T TRUE, BUT

5994
04:02:05,611 --> 04:02:08,146
WE HAVEN'T HEARD IF WHAT WE'RE 

5995
04:02:07,145 --> 04:02:10,115
DOING NOW IS TRUE.

5996
04:02:08,213 --> 04:02:11,215
AND THE BEST THING TO DO IS 

5997
04:02:10,182 --> 04:02:15,053
RECOGNIZE YOU DON'T KNOW AND 

5998
04:02:11,282 --> 04:02:16,454
PROCEED IN A WAY WHERE YOU GET A

5999
04:02:15,120 --> 04:02:18,556
DECENT RESULT NO MATTER WHAT 

6000
04:02:16,521 --> 04:02:19,791
HAPPENS, AND THAT'S WHAT WE TRY 

6001
04:02:18,623 --> 04:02:22,961
TO DO AT BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY.

6002
04:02:19,858 --> 04:02:25,463
WE DO NOT THINK WE CAN MAKE 

6003
04:02:23,028 --> 04:02:25,763
MONEY BY MAKING MACROECONOMIC 

6004
04:02:25,530 --> 04:02:29,467
PREDICTIONS.

6005
04:02:25,830 --> 04:02:31,836
WE DO THINK WE CAN BE PRETTY 

6006
04:02:29,534 --> 04:02:35,574
DARN SURE WE'LL GET A REASONABLE

6007
04:02:31,903 --> 04:02:36,842
RESULT UNDER POLICIES THAT WILL 

6008
04:02:35,640 --> 04:02:38,276
NONACTION WISE RESULT IF WE 

6009
04:02:36,908 --> 04:02:42,314
COULD DO THAT SORT OF THING. 

6010
04:02:38,343 --> 04:02:44,115
>> IT'S NOT AT ALL CLEAR WHETHER

6011
04:02:42,381 --> 04:02:45,583
LARRY IS RIGHT OR WRONG. 

6012
04:02:44,182 --> 04:02:48,152
>> HE'S A SMART MAN, THOUGH. 

6013
04:02:45,650 --> 04:02:50,755
>> HE IS A SMART MAN, AND IT'S 

6014
04:02:48,219 --> 04:02:52,423
COURAGEOUS OF HIM TO RAISE IT 

6015
04:02:50,822 --> 04:02:54,292
TO -- HE'S FRANKLY THE ONLY ONE 

6016
04:02:52,490 --> 04:02:55,226
TALKING THAT WAY, WHICH I 

6017
04:02:54,359 --> 04:02:57,228
ADMIRE, BY THE WAY. 

6018
04:02:55,293 --> 04:02:57,895
>> GUARANTEES HE WON'T GET A 

6019
04:02:57,295 --> 04:02:59,297
POSITION IN THE ADMINISTRATION. 

6020
04:02:57,962 --> 04:03:00,832
>> WELL, THAT'S ONE OF THE 

6021
04:02:59,364 --> 04:03:02,100
REASONS I ADMIRE HIM.

6022
04:03:00,899 --> 04:03:03,402
AND NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING 

6023
04:03:02,167 --> 04:03:05,804
WRONG WITH HAVING A POSITION IN 

6024
04:03:03,468 --> 04:03:07,539
THE ADMINISTRATION, BUT I THINK 

6025
04:03:05,870 --> 04:03:13,345
PEOPLE WHO KIND OF TELL IT THE 

6026
04:03:07,606 --> 04:03:16,548
WAY THEY THINK IT IS, I LIKE IT.

6027
04:03:13,412 --> 04:03:18,283
>> THIS QUESTION CIRCLES BACK TO

6028
04:03:16,615 --> 04:03:19,217
BANKING, WHICH YOU TOUCHED ON 

6029
04:03:18,350 --> 04:03:22,620
EARLIER.

6030
04:03:19,284 --> 04:03:23,988
JEROME BERNARD FROM SWITZERLAND 

6031
04:03:22,687 --> 04:03:27,592
WRITES, CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY YOU 

6032
04:03:24,055 --> 04:03:28,226
EXITED MOST BANK STOCKS IN 2020 

6033
04:03:27,658 --> 04:03:29,160
EXCEPT BANK OF AMERICA, AND WHAT

6034
04:03:28,292 --> 04:03:29,728
IS YOUR FUTURE ON THE BANKING 

6035
04:03:29,227 --> 04:03:33,164
INDUSTRY?

6036
04:03:29,795 --> 04:03:36,234
>> I LIKE BANKS GENERALLY, I 

6037
04:03:33,231 --> 04:03:38,703
JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE PROPORTION 

6038
04:03:36,301 --> 04:03:41,806
COMPARED TO THE POSSIBLE RISK 

6039
04:03:38,770 --> 04:03:42,039
IF -- WHICH SO FAR WE HAVEN'T 

6040
04:03:41,873 --> 04:03:44,142
GOTTEN.

6041
04:03:42,106 --> 04:03:44,409
WE WERE OVER 10% OF BANK OF 

6042
04:03:44,209 --> 04:03:46,744
AMERICA.

6043
04:03:44,476 --> 04:03:49,647
IT'S A REAL PAIN IN THE NECK, 

6044
04:03:46,811 --> 04:03:52,350
BOTH IN THE BANK, MORE TO THE 

6045
04:03:49,714 --> 04:03:56,121
BANKS THAN US.

6046
04:03:52,416 --> 04:03:58,423
AND I LIKE THE BANK OF AMERICA, 

6047
04:03:56,187 --> 04:04:00,892
AND I LIKE BERNARD VERY MUCH AND

6048
04:03:58,490 --> 04:04:03,328
I LIKE THE BANKING BUSINESS 

6049
04:04:00,959 --> 04:04:05,964
FINE, SO WE TOOK THAT UP, BUT WE

6050
04:04:03,395 --> 04:04:06,264
TOOK THE OVERALL BANK POSITION 

6051
04:04:06,031 --> 04:04:10,068
DOWN.

6052
04:04:06,331 --> 04:04:12,803
WE DIDN'T WANT TO GO ABOVE 10, 

6053
04:04:10,135 --> 04:04:15,073
AND WE DID WANT TO INCREASE THE 

6054
04:04:12,870 --> 04:04:19,311
B OF A POSITION, BUT WE OVERALL 

6055
04:04:15,140 --> 04:04:19,878
DIDN'T WANT AS MUCH IN BANKS AS 

6056
04:04:19,377 --> 04:04:22,647
WE HAD.

6057
04:04:19,945 --> 04:04:24,315
THE BANKING BUSINESS WAS WAY 

6058
04:04:22,714 --> 04:04:25,784
BETTER THAN IT WAS IN THE UNITED

6059
04:04:24,382 --> 04:04:27,518
STATES 10 OR 15 YEARS AGO.

6060
04:04:25,850 --> 04:04:28,920
THE BANKING BUSINESS AROUND THE 

6061
04:04:27,585 --> 04:04:30,989
WORLD IN VARIOUS PLACES MIGHT 

6062
04:04:28,987 --> 04:04:34,225
WORRY ME, BUT OUR BANKS ARE IN 

6063
04:04:31,056 --> 04:04:34,926
FAR, FAR BETTER SHAPE THAN 10 OR

6064
04:04:34,292 --> 04:04:36,594
15 YEARS AGO.

6065
04:04:34,993 --> 04:04:39,798
BUT WHEN THINGS FROZE FOR A 

6066
04:04:36,661 --> 04:04:40,999
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THE 

6067
04:04:39,864 --> 04:04:42,200
BIGGEST THING THE BANKS HAD 

6068
04:04:41,066 --> 04:04:44,569
GOING FOR THEM IS THAT THE 

6069
04:04:42,267 --> 04:04:46,471
FEDERAL RESERVE WAS BUYING THEM.

6070
04:04:44,636 --> 04:04:47,505
AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THEY'RE

6071
04:04:46,538 --> 04:04:52,176
NOT BEHIND BERKSHIRE.

6072
04:04:47,571 --> 04:04:52,477
IT'S UP TO US TO TAKE CARE OF 

6073
04:04:52,243 --> 04:04:53,845
OURSELVES. 

6074
04:04:52,543 --> 04:04:56,247
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM MATT

6075
04:04:53,912 --> 04:04:58,516
WHY IN LOS ANGELES.

6076
04:04:56,314 --> 04:04:59,751
YOU RECENTLY PURCHASED A LARGE 

6077
04:04:58,583 --> 04:05:01,252
STAKE IN VERIZON.

6078
04:04:59,818 --> 04:05:04,723
FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES COULD 

6079
04:05:01,319 --> 04:05:07,625
YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

6080
04:05:04,790 --> 04:05:09,427
MANY SEE TELECOM AS -- ONLY FOR 

6081
04:05:07,692 --> 04:05:11,229
THE OTHER TECH COMPANIES TO TAKE

6082
04:05:09,494 --> 04:05:15,900
ADVANTAGE AND CABTURE MOST OF 

6083
04:05:11,295 --> 04:05:19,804
THE VALUE CREATED LIKE FACEBOOK,

6084
04:05:15,967 --> 04:05:20,972
UBER, AIRBNB AND DOOR DASH. 

6085
04:05:19,871 --> 04:05:22,907
>> I THINK HE'S ANALYZED THE 

6086
04:05:21,039 --> 04:05:25,343
SITUATION WELL, BUT WE ARE NOT 

6087
04:05:22,974 --> 04:05:27,645
IN THE BUSINESS OF WHY WE OWN A 

6088
04:05:25,410 --> 04:05:29,481
STOCK WHICH WE MIGHT BUY MORE 

6089
04:05:27,712 --> 04:05:30,682
OF, SELL, OR WHO KNOWS.

6090
04:05:29,548 --> 04:05:34,152
BUT HE'S ON HIS OWN.

6091
04:05:30,749 --> 04:05:38,590
BUT HE SOUNDS LIKE HE'S VERY 

6092
04:05:34,219 --> 04:05:38,857
CAPABLE OF THINKING IT THROUGH 

6093
04:05:38,657 --> 04:05:46,131
HIMSELF. 

6094
04:05:38,924 --> 04:05:48,933
>> SLAVEN WRITES IN, SENATOR 

6095
04:05:46,197 --> 04:05:50,701
JOSH HAWLEY RECENTLY SIGNED A 

6096
04:05:49,000 --> 04:05:52,436
PROPOSAL THAT WILL BAN -- WHILE 

6097
04:05:50,768 --> 04:05:55,340
THIS LEGISLATION IS UNLIKELY TO 

6098
04:05:52,503 --> 04:05:55,940
GO THROUGH, INCREASING 

6099
04:05:55,407 --> 04:05:58,343
ANTI-TRUST LEGISLATION COULD 

6100
04:05:56,007 --> 04:06:01,579
PRESENT A RESCUE FOR BERKSHIRE.

6101
04:05:58,409 --> 04:06:03,181
HAS BERKSHIRE'S BOARD DISCUSSED 

6102
04:06:01,646 --> 04:06:08,119
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN OVER THE 

6103
04:06:03,248 --> 04:06:10,221
LONG-TERM IF BERKSHIRE WERE 

6104
04:06:08,186 --> 04:06:10,521
BANNED TO ACQUIRING CONTROLLED 

6105
04:06:10,288 --> 04:06:12,089
BUSINESSES?

6106
04:06:10,588 --> 04:06:14,392
>> WE DON'T DISCUSS THAT, BUT 

6107
04:06:12,156 --> 04:06:17,462
THE BOARD IS VERY, VERY FAMILIAR

6108
04:06:14,459 --> 04:06:21,232
WITH WHAT BERKSHIRE DOES, WHY 

6109
04:06:17,529 --> 04:06:24,269
THEY DO IT, YOU KNOW, HOW WE 

6110
04:06:21,299 --> 04:06:25,770
THINK IN DEPLOYING CAPITAL.

6111
04:06:24,336 --> 04:06:27,905
BUT WE COULD -- EVERYBODY KNOWS 

6112
04:06:25,837 --> 04:06:30,174
THAT IF YOU CHANGE THE 

6113
04:06:27,972 --> 04:06:32,310
ANTI-TRUST LAWS IT COULD CHANGE 

6114
04:06:30,241 --> 04:06:34,679
THINGS FOR BERKSHIRE.

6115
04:06:32,377 --> 04:06:37,716
IF YOU CHANGE THE -- IT COULD 

6116
04:06:34,746 --> 04:06:39,050
CHANGE THINGS FOR BERKSHIRE.

6117
04:06:37,782 --> 04:06:43,655
WE COULD SPEND HOURS DISCUSSING 

6118
04:06:39,117 --> 04:06:44,622
THEM, BUT IN THE END, IT IS A 

6119
04:06:43,722 --> 04:06:44,855
22.3% RISK THAT SOMETHING 

6120
04:06:44,689 --> 04:06:46,424
CHANGES?

6121
04:06:44,922 --> 04:06:49,160
IT'S A GOOD WAY TO FILL THE TIME

6122
04:06:46,491 --> 04:06:51,229
AT BOARD MEETINGS, AND IF YOU'RE

6123
04:06:49,227 --> 04:06:52,530
GETTING $300,000, $400,000, A 

6124
04:06:51,296 --> 04:06:53,698
YEAR AS A BOARD DIRECTOR YOU 

6125
04:06:52,597 --> 04:06:56,834
MIGHT WANT TO SPEND YOUR TIME 

6126
04:06:53,765 --> 04:06:57,168
DOING THAT, BUT WE REALLY DON'T 

6127
04:06:56,901 --> 04:06:58,703
FOCUS ON THAT.

6128
04:06:57,235 --> 04:07:00,672
THE MAIN THING ABOUT BERKSHIRE 

6129
04:06:58,770 --> 04:07:02,807
IS HOW TO PRESERVE THE CULTURE, 

6130
04:07:00,738 --> 04:07:04,709
HOW TO MAKE SURE IF YOU GET THE 

6131
04:07:02,874 --> 04:07:05,911
WRONG PERSON AS A CEO, YOU CAN 

6132
04:07:04,776 --> 04:07:07,645
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

6133
04:07:05,977 --> 04:07:09,146
THAT'S THE BIGGEST RISK THE 

6134
04:07:07,712 --> 04:07:10,248
BOARD HAS IS IF YOU PICK THE 

6135
04:07:09,213 --> 04:07:11,715
WRONG CEO.

6136
04:07:10,315 --> 04:07:13,251
I HAVE BEEN ON 20 BOARDS AND 

6137
04:07:11,782 --> 04:07:14,252
THIS HAPPENED MORE THAN ONCE.

6138
04:07:13,318 --> 04:07:16,187
SOMETIMES IT'S A TERRIBLE 

6139
04:07:14,319 --> 04:07:21,559
PROBLEM TO GET RID OF THEM.

6140
04:07:16,254 --> 04:07:23,394
YEARS GO BY, AND, YOU KNOW, IF 

6141
04:07:21,626 --> 04:07:26,664
YOU JUST SIT THERE AND COLLECT 

6142
04:07:23,461 --> 04:07:29,100
YOUR $300,000, $400,000, A YEAR 

6143
04:07:26,731 --> 04:07:30,835
AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE KEEPS 

6144
04:07:29,167 --> 04:07:32,270
PROPOSING YOU GET AN INCREASE 

6145
04:07:30,902 --> 04:07:34,372
FROM TIME TO TIME -- AND IT'S 

6146
04:07:32,337 --> 04:07:39,477
WORSE YET IF HE'S A NICE PERSON,

6147
04:07:34,439 --> 04:07:41,645
YOU KNOW, DOING HIS BEST.

6148
04:07:39,544 --> 04:07:43,982
IT'S -- BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO 

6149
04:07:41,712 --> 04:07:45,816
SPEND A LOT OF TIME -- WE MAY DO

6150
04:07:44,049 --> 04:07:48,653
IT ON A PERSONAL BASIS, BUT 

6151
04:07:45,883 --> 04:07:49,754
WE'RE NOT GOING TAKE A LOT OF 

6152
04:07:48,720 --> 04:07:52,991
PEOPLE -- WE WANT THEM TO KNOW 

6153
04:07:49,821 --> 04:07:55,894
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH BSF AND HOW

6154
04:07:53,058 --> 04:07:57,762
KATIE'S DOING AND IF THE CASEY 

6155
04:07:55,960 --> 04:07:58,897
THING COULD -- IN A MATERIAL WAY

6156
04:07:57,829 --> 04:08:01,165
AND SO ON.

6157
04:07:58,964 --> 04:08:02,667
WE REALLY DON'T -- EXCEPT A 

6158
04:08:01,232 --> 04:08:04,902
PRIVATE SIDE THING, WE DON'T 

6159
04:08:02,734 --> 04:08:08,205
START TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE 

6160
04:08:04,969 --> 04:08:08,907
EFFECTS WILL BE IN 2050 IF THIS 

6161
04:08:08,272 --> 04:08:10,942
PROJECTION OR THAT PROJECTION 

6162
04:08:08,973 --> 04:08:11,175
ISN'T MET.

6163
04:08:11,009 --> 04:08:16,314
CHARLIE?

6164
04:08:11,242 --> 04:08:18,649
>> NOTHING TO ADD.

6165
04:08:16,381 --> 04:08:20,217
>> THIS QUESTION WAS SENT IN BY 

6166
04:08:18,716 --> 04:08:21,585
DON GRAHAM DURING THE MEETING 

6167
04:08:20,284 --> 04:08:22,253
BASED ON SOMETHING YOU SAID 

6168
04:08:21,652 --> 04:08:25,357
EARLIER TODAY.

6169
04:08:22,320 --> 04:08:28,460
HE SAYS, WHY DOES WARREN SAY 

6170
04:08:25,423 --> 04:08:29,860
BERKSHIRE'S ABILITY TO ENSURE 

6171
04:08:28,526 --> 04:08:32,263
ENORMOUS RISK QUICKLY IS A LESS 

6172
04:08:29,927 --> 04:08:32,664
VALUABLE ASSET THAN IT USED TO 

6173
04:08:32,330 --> 04:08:36,101
BE?

6174
04:08:32,731 --> 04:08:38,036
>> WELL, BECAUSE THE DEMAND IS 

6175
04:08:36,167 --> 04:08:39,904
LESS, BASICBASICALLY, ON THAT.

6176
04:08:38,103 --> 04:08:43,508
IF YOU TAKE A PERIOD LIKE 

6177
04:08:39,971 --> 04:08:44,742
HAPPENED AFTER 9/11, I 

6178
04:08:43,574 --> 04:08:48,847
REMEMBER -- I MAY BE WRONG ON 

6179
04:08:44,808 --> 04:08:52,383
THE DETAILS, BUT KAT AID PACIFIC

6180
04:08:48,913 --> 04:08:53,985
THEY COULDN'T LAND IN HONG KONG 

6181
04:08:52,450 --> 04:08:57,355
UNLESS THEY HAD AN INSURANCE 

6182
04:08:54,052 --> 04:08:57,722
POLICY BY MONDAY OF THE 

6183
04:08:57,422 --> 04:08:58,056
FOLLOWING WEEK.

6184
04:08:57,789 --> 04:08:59,190
WE CAN DO IT.

6185
04:08:58,123 --> 04:09:00,525
SHE CALLS ME UP.

6186
04:08:59,257 --> 04:09:02,426
HE THINKS OF A PRICE.

6187
04:09:00,592 --> 04:09:06,397
I THINK OF A PRICE.

6188
04:09:02,493 --> 04:09:08,332
BUT WE CAN DO IT.

6189
04:09:06,464 --> 04:09:08,566
WE CAN TAKE THE LOSS IF IT 

6190
04:09:08,399 --> 04:09:10,401
HAPPENS.

6191
04:09:08,633 --> 04:09:14,572
THEY CALLED ME IN THE SEARS 

6192
04:09:10,468 --> 04:09:17,608
TOWER, I THINK, BACK THEN.

6193
04:09:14,639 --> 04:09:19,510
NOBODY KNEW -- THEY DIDN'T KNOW 

6194
04:09:17,675 --> 04:09:20,111
WEATHER BOMBS MIGHT BE PLACED 

6195
04:09:19,577 --> 04:09:22,747
ALL OVER.

6196
04:09:20,178 --> 04:09:25,984
SO THEY WANTED MORE INSURANCE 

6197
04:09:22,814 --> 04:09:27,352
ALL OF A SUDDEN AND WE GAVE THEM

6198
04:09:26,051 --> 04:09:29,720
A PRICE.

6199
04:09:27,419 --> 04:09:30,889
SO THAT SORT OF AN ENVIRONMENT 

6200
04:09:29,787 --> 04:09:33,557
HASN'T REALLY PERSISTED.

6201
04:09:30,955 --> 04:09:37,361
THERE WERE TIMES, I THINK, 

6202
04:09:33,624 --> 04:09:37,662
PERHAPS AIG, HE WOULD DO THE 

6203
04:09:37,428 --> 04:09:39,931
SAME THING.

6204
04:09:37,728 --> 04:09:41,499
BUT THERE WEREN'T 10 OR 20 

6205
04:09:39,998 --> 04:09:42,533
PEOPLE, AND THEY NEEDED BIG 

6206
04:09:41,566 --> 04:09:44,769
LIMITS IN SOME CASES.

6207
04:09:42,600 --> 04:09:47,171
AND WE WERE GOOD FOR IT.

6208
04:09:44,836 --> 04:09:48,840
AND THEY KNEW IF THEY BOUGHT THE

6209
04:09:47,238 --> 04:09:50,875
INSURANCE AND IT HAPPENED, WE'D 

6210
04:09:48,907 --> 04:09:53,511
WRITE A CHECK AND IT WOULD 

6211
04:09:50,942 --> 04:09:55,346
CLEAR.

6212
04:09:53,578 --> 04:09:56,647
AJIT, YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING. 

6213
04:09:55,413 --> 04:09:57,449
>> YEAH, IN ADDITION TO THE 

6214
04:09:56,714 --> 04:10:01,719
DEMAND SIDE, THE SUPPLY SIDE HAS

6215
04:09:57,515 --> 04:10:02,320
BECOME A LOT MORE.

6216
04:10:01,786 --> 04:10:04,422
COMPETITIVE.

6217
04:10:02,387 --> 04:10:05,322
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CAN PUT UP 

6218
04:10:04,489 --> 04:10:08,693
BIG LIMITS.

6219
04:10:05,389 --> 04:10:11,462
NOT AS MUCH AS WE DO, BUT THEY 

6220
04:10:08,760 --> 04:10:11,695
CAN PUT UP $1 BILLION PRETTY 

6221
04:10:11,529 --> 04:10:12,296
EASILY.

6222
04:10:11,762 --> 04:10:14,699
THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE WE 

6223
04:10:12,363 --> 04:10:15,533
HAVE, WE STILL HAVE, BUT IT'S NO

6224
04:10:14,766 --> 04:10:17,435
LONGER A BIG A DEAL AS IT USED 

6225
04:10:15,600 --> 04:10:19,604
TO BE.

6226
04:10:17,502 --> 04:10:21,138
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM 

6227
04:10:19,671 --> 04:10:23,341
SHAREHOLDER IN SCOTLAND WHO 

6228
04:10:21,205 --> 04:10:25,509
WANTS TO KNOW, WARREN, CHARLIE 

6229
04:10:23,407 --> 04:10:28,679
AND GREG'S VIEWS ON HOW KRAFT 

6230
04:10:25,576 --> 04:10:31,882
HEINZ HAS PERFORMED OVER THE 

6231
04:10:28,746 --> 04:10:32,683
LAST 12 MONTHS COMPARED TO THE 

6232
04:10:31,949 --> 04:10:33,718
DISAPPOINTING PERFORMANCE 

6233
04:10:32,750 --> 04:10:36,720
PRECOVID AND WHAT ARE YOUR 

6234
04:10:33,785 --> 04:10:37,121
LONG-TERM VIEWS ON KRAFT HEINZ 

6235
04:10:36,787 --> 04:10:40,592
PROSPECTS?

6236
04:10:37,188 --> 04:10:43,361
>> WELL, I THINK THAT GREG'S ON 

6237
04:10:40,658 --> 04:10:44,195
THE BOARD, SO HE MIGHT -- I 

6238
04:10:43,427 --> 04:10:47,498
DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE IN A 

6239
04:10:44,262 --> 04:10:47,899
POSITION TO GIVE ADVICE ON KRAFT

6240
04:10:47,565 --> 04:10:55,373
HEINZ.

6241
04:10:47,966 --> 04:10:57,976
WE ENTERED A -- IN EFFECT, A 

6242
04:10:55,440 --> 04:11:00,278
SEMIFORMAL PARTNERSHIP WITH 3G 

6243
04:10:58,042 --> 04:11:02,313
MANY YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS JUST 

6244
04:11:00,345 --> 04:11:03,113
THE HEINZ DEAL AND WENT ON TO 

6245
04:11:02,380 --> 04:11:07,384
ACQUIRE KRAFT.

6246
04:11:03,180 --> 04:11:09,220
WE'RE THEIR PARTNERS, AND 

6247
04:11:07,451 --> 04:11:12,356
THEY'VE DONE MORE THAN -- THEY 

6248
04:11:09,287 --> 04:11:15,693
HOLD UP THEIR SHARE, AND WE DO 

6249
04:11:12,423 --> 04:11:18,496
WHAT WE SAID WE'D DO GOING IN, 

6250
04:11:15,760 --> 04:11:19,864
WHICH IS TO BE A FINANCIAL 

6251
04:11:18,563 --> 04:11:20,865
PARTNER, AND THEY'RE MORE OF THE

6252
04:11:19,931 --> 04:11:22,567
OPERATING PARTNER.

6253
04:11:20,932 --> 04:11:24,602
WE PARTICIPATE TO A DEGREE IN 

6254
04:11:22,634 --> 04:11:25,803
ANY BIG DECISIONS.

6255
04:11:24,669 --> 04:11:32,543
AND THEY WOULD LISTEN TO US.

6256
04:11:25,869 --> 04:11:33,110
BUT WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY -- IN 

6257
04:11:32,610 --> 04:11:34,679
TERMS OF KRAFT HEINZ STOCK, 

6258
04:11:33,177 --> 04:11:35,012
THAT'S UP TO SOMEBODY ELSE TO 

6259
04:11:34,746 --> 04:11:36,948
EVALUATE. 

6260
04:11:35,079 --> 04:11:38,716
>> THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD, 

6261
04:11:37,015 --> 04:11:39,650
WARREN, IS I THINK WE'RE VERY 

6262
04:11:38,783 --> 04:11:42,019
COMFORTABLE WITH THE FACT THAT 

6263
04:11:39,717 --> 04:11:45,189
THEY PUT A STRONG MANAGER IN 

6264
04:11:42,086 --> 04:11:47,458
PLACE IN MIGUEL, AND HE'S PUT A 

6265
04:11:45,256 --> 04:11:50,161
VERY GOOD TEAM IN PLACE AT KRAFT

6266
04:11:47,525 --> 04:11:51,629
HEINZ, SO WE'RE PLEASE AT WITH 

6267
04:11:50,228 --> 04:11:52,830
THE LEADERSHIP AND AND 

6268
04:11:51,696 --> 04:11:55,166
MANAGEMENT TEAM AND THEY'RE 

6269
04:11:52,897 --> 04:11:57,001
FOCUSED ON EXECUTING AND THEY'VE

6270
04:11:55,233 --> 04:11:59,403
GONE FORWARD IN RATIONALIZING 

6271
04:11:57,068 --> 04:12:01,272
THEIR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND 

6272
04:11:59,470 --> 04:12:02,874
MANAGING THEIR DEBT STRUCTURE, 

6273
04:12:01,339 --> 04:12:03,141
SO PLEASED WITH THE PATH 

6274
04:12:02,941 --> 04:12:05,276
FORWARD. 

6275
04:12:03,208 --> 04:12:09,079
>> YEAH, WE FEEL BETTER ABOUT 

6276
04:12:05,343 --> 04:12:13,151
THE -- ONE OF THE -- THIS IS A 

6277
04:12:09,146 --> 04:12:16,787
MORE GENERAL SUBJECT, BUT ONE OF

6278
04:12:13,217 --> 04:12:19,089
THE SUBJECTS I MIGHT WRITE ABOUT

6279
04:12:16,854 --> 04:12:21,959
IN THE FUTURE REPORTS IS THE 

6280
04:12:19,156 --> 04:12:23,661
PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE MYTHS 

6281
04:12:22,026 --> 04:12:25,630
THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THEIR OWN

6282
04:12:23,728 --> 04:12:27,798
ORGANIZATIONS AND I'VE SEEN THAT

6283
04:12:25,697 --> 04:12:30,234
SO MANY TIMES IN VARIOUS FORMS.

6284
04:12:27,865 --> 04:12:32,870
TO SOME EXTENT, THE PROBLEM HAS 

6285
04:12:30,301 --> 04:12:37,174
BECOME ACCENTUATED IN THE LAST 

6286
04:12:32,937 --> 04:12:39,143
20 OR 30 YEARS BECAUSE THE CEO 

6287
04:12:37,241 --> 04:12:39,410
OFTEN WORKS WITH INVESTOR 

6288
04:12:39,210 --> 04:12:43,514
RELATIONS.

6289
04:12:39,477 --> 04:12:45,216
THEY SAY, WE HAVE TO HAVE 

6290
04:12:43,581 --> 04:12:47,485
CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE 

6291
04:12:45,283 --> 04:12:48,852
ANALYST COMMUNITY SOME THEY GO 

6292
04:12:47,551 --> 04:12:49,920
ON EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS AND 

6293
04:12:48,919 --> 04:12:51,322
REPEAT CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT 

6294
04:12:49,987 --> 04:12:55,292
THEIR COMPANY, AND IT BECOMES 

6295
04:12:51,389 --> 04:12:55,559
PART OF -- SORT OF THE CAT

6296
04:12:55,359 --> 04:12:56,994
CATECHISM.

6297
04:12:55,626 --> 04:13:00,064
NOBODY'S GOING ON TWO MONTH'S 

6298
04:12:57,061 --> 04:13:01,399
THE CEO SAID ONE THING AND SAY, 

6299
04:13:00,131 --> 04:13:01,566
THAT ACTUALLY REALLY ISN'T THE 

6300
04:13:01,466 --> 04:13:02,767
WAY.

6301
04:13:01,632 --> 04:13:03,267
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE 

6302
04:13:02,834 --> 04:13:07,038
COURSE.

6303
04:13:03,334 --> 04:13:08,005
SO IF YOU GET THESE MYTHS, AND 

6304
04:13:07,105 --> 04:13:08,706
THEY CAN OCCUR IN A LOT OF 

6305
04:13:08,072 --> 04:13:10,608
DIFFERENT WAYS.

6306
04:13:08,773 --> 04:13:12,310
I CAN GIVE A LOT OF EXAMPLES, 

6307
04:13:10,675 --> 04:13:15,646
WHICH I WON'T DO.

6308
04:13:12,377 --> 04:13:16,781
WON'T TELL MY FRIENDS IN 

6309
04:13:15,713 --> 04:13:17,048
CORPORATE, GOING TO SQUEAL ON 

6310
04:13:16,848 --> 04:13:19,283
THEM.

6311
04:13:17,115 --> 04:13:22,620
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF MYTHOLOGY 

6312
04:13:19,350 --> 04:13:24,221
THAT GETS HANDED DOWN FROM ONE 

6313
04:13:22,687 --> 04:13:26,190
CEO TO THE NEXT, AND THE 

6314
04:13:24,288 --> 04:13:29,060
SUCCEEDING CEO, SAY, THE GUY 

6315
04:13:26,257 --> 04:13:31,161
THAT PICKS HIM, YOU KNOW, WAS ON

6316
04:13:29,126 --> 04:13:32,997
THE WRONG COURSE OR HAS BEEN 

6317
04:13:31,228 --> 04:13:33,597
TELLING YOU SOMETHING SMG THAT 

6318
04:13:33,064 --> 04:13:35,899
ISN'T TRUE.

6319
04:13:33,664 --> 04:13:39,603
THEN HE STARTS REPEATING IT, AND

6320
04:13:35,966 --> 04:13:41,939
IT LEADS TO ENORMOUS ERRORS.

6321
04:13:39,670 --> 04:13:43,541
BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL THE STORY 

6322
04:13:42,006 --> 04:13:45,142
WITHOUT GIVING EXAMPLES, AND I 

6323
04:13:43,607 --> 04:13:47,445
DON'T LIKE TO GIVE EXAMPLES.

6324
04:13:45,209 --> 04:13:49,647
SO WE'LL SEE WHEN I WRITE ABOUT 

6325
04:13:47,511 --> 04:13:51,115
IT SOMETIME.

6326
04:13:49,714 --> 04:13:51,882
CHARLIE, YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT 

6327
04:13:51,182 --> 04:13:54,618
SOME THOUGHTS.

6328
04:13:51,949 --> 04:13:56,754
HE'S HAD A RINGSIDE SEAT TO A 

6329
04:13:54,685 --> 04:13:58,556
LOT OF -- HE'S BEEN ON BOARDS I 

6330
04:13:56,821 --> 04:13:59,857
HAVEN'T BEEN ON.

6331
04:13:58,623 --> 04:14:02,193
EXTENDS BEYOND BUSINESS TO 

6332
04:13:59,924 --> 04:14:02,426
EDUCATION AND TO, WELL, A LOT OF

6333
04:14:02,260 --> 04:14:03,427
AREAS. 

6334
04:14:02,493 --> 04:14:08,899
>> WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS 

6335
04:14:03,494 --> 04:14:10,634
THE WAY YOU PRATTLE OUT ALL THE 

6336
04:14:08,966 --> 04:14:11,602
TIME, YOU'RE POUNDING BACK IN 

6337
04:14:10,701 --> 04:14:15,139
EVEN IF IT'S WRONG.

6338
04:14:11,669 --> 04:14:19,243
SO ONE OF MY FAVORITE REMARKS IN

6339
04:14:15,205 --> 04:14:23,647
THE HISTORY OF HUMAN REMARKS WAS

6340
04:14:19,310 --> 04:14:24,415
BY SIR CEDRIC HARDWICK WHO IS A 

6341
04:14:23,714 --> 04:14:27,651
GREAT BRITISH ACTOR.

6342
04:14:24,482 --> 04:14:29,787
HE SAID, I HAVE BEEN A GREAT 

6343
04:14:27,718 --> 04:14:31,755
ACTOR FOR SO LONG THAT I NO 

6344
04:14:29,854 --> 04:14:33,090
LONGER KNOW WHAT I TRULY THINK 

6345
04:14:31,822 --> 04:14:35,192
ON ANY SUBJECT, AND I THINK THAT

6346
04:14:33,157 --> 04:14:37,762
HAPPENS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND 

6347
04:14:35,259 --> 04:14:38,062
IT HAPPENS TO VIRTUALLY EVERY 

6348
04:14:37,829 --> 04:14:41,098
POLITICIAN. 

6349
04:14:38,129 --> 04:14:41,432
>> AND IT GETS EMBEDDED IN 

6350
04:14:41,165 --> 04:14:43,167
CORPORATIONS.

6351
04:14:41,499 --> 04:14:45,002
AND THE TROUBLE IS NOW THE CEOS 

6352
04:14:43,234 --> 04:14:46,470
SPEAK OUT SO OFTEN -- SO IF 

6353
04:14:45,069 --> 04:14:48,373
THEY'VE GOT SOME CRAZY THING 

6354
04:14:46,537 --> 04:14:50,374
THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT THEIR 

6355
04:14:48,439 --> 04:14:52,242
COMPANY AND THEY KEEP REPEATING 

6356
04:14:50,441 --> 04:14:54,778
IT, THE SUBORDINATES AREN'T 

6357
04:14:52,309 --> 04:14:56,714
GOING TO -- AND CHARLIE SAID, 

6358
04:14:54,845 --> 04:14:56,914
THEY JUST BELIEVE IT AFTER A 

6359
04:14:56,780 --> 04:14:59,650
WHILE.

6360
04:14:56,981 --> 04:15:01,518
AND IT'S DANGEROUS.

6361
04:14:59,717 --> 04:15:04,254
>> YES, AND OBVIOUSLY THE YOUNG 

6362
04:15:01,585 --> 04:15:06,390
PEOPLE GET THESE IDEAS AFTER 

6363
04:15:04,321 --> 04:15:09,393
THEIR LIBERAL EDUCATIONS, THINK 

6364
04:15:06,457 --> 04:15:10,127
THAT GOD HAS GIVEN THEM DIRECT 

6365
04:15:09,460 --> 04:15:12,229
INSIGHTS, AND THEY'RE JUST AS 

6366
04:15:10,194 --> 04:15:13,430
CRAZY AS THE POLITICIANS. 

6367
04:15:12,296 --> 04:15:14,532
>> THERE ARE SOME OLD PEOPLE 

6368
04:15:13,497 --> 04:15:15,632
THAT HAVE THAT, TOO. 

6369
04:15:14,599 --> 04:15:16,834
>> WELL, THE OLD PEOPLE ARE 

6370
04:15:15,699 --> 04:15:20,137
ALREADY CRAZY, BUT -- 

6371
04:15:16,901 --> 04:15:20,337
>> THEY'RE GOING TO DIE SOONER, 

6372
04:15:20,204 --> 04:15:23,073
SO -- 

6373
04:15:20,404 --> 04:15:26,644
>> WE HAVE OUR OLD INSANITIES.

6374
04:15:23,140 --> 04:15:26,877
THE NEW INSANITIES, THE YOUNG 

6375
04:15:26,711 --> 04:15:29,346
GET. 

6376
04:15:26,944 --> 04:15:31,182
>> ALL RIGHT, THIS QUESTION 

6377
04:15:29,413 --> 04:15:33,851
COMES FROM BILL BEGLEY WHO SAID,

6378
04:15:31,249 --> 04:15:38,689
COULD YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED 

6379
04:15:33,918 --> 04:15:41,325
TO THE JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN 

6380
04:15:38,755 --> 04:15:41,859
BERKSHIRE -- AND AMAZON ABOUT 

6381
04:15:41,392 --> 04:15:42,093
HEALTH-CARE IN THE UNITED 

6382
04:15:41,926 --> 04:15:47,932
STATES.

6383
04:15:42,159 --> 04:15:48,199
THE ONLY ITEM I READ WAS IT WAS 

6384
04:15:47,999 --> 04:15:49,900
DISBANDED.

6385
04:15:48,266 --> 04:15:51,035
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO BE 

6386
04:15:49,967 --> 04:15:53,704
LEARNED AFTER YOUR EFFORT?

6387
04:15:51,102 --> 04:15:57,441
>> WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT 

6388
04:15:53,771 --> 04:15:58,375
CHANGING AROUND AN INDUSTRY 

6389
04:15:57,508 --> 04:16:01,078
THAT'S 17% OF GDP, AND WE 

6390
04:15:58,442 --> 04:16:02,279
LEARNED -- WE ACCOMPLISHED A 

6391
04:16:01,145 --> 04:16:03,947
LESSER OBJECTIVE, WHICH WAS 

6392
04:16:02,346 --> 04:16:06,684
PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT TO US 

6393
04:16:04,014 --> 04:16:08,986
EVEN THAN J.P. MORGAN OR AMAZON,

6394
04:16:06,751 --> 04:16:10,855
BECAUSE WE KNEW LESS ABOUT OUR 

6395
04:16:09,053 --> 04:16:13,690
OWN SYSTEM THAN THEY DID.

6396
04:16:10,922 --> 04:16:15,993
THEY KNEW -- THEY'RE A MORE 

6397
04:16:13,757 --> 04:16:17,494
CENTRALIZED OPERATION, SO WE GOT

6398
04:16:16,060 --> 04:16:21,031
SOME BENEFITS IN THE SENSE THAT 

6399
04:16:17,561 --> 04:16:26,237
WE LOOKED AT 60 OR 70 DIFFERENT 

6400
04:16:21,098 --> 04:16:28,272
OPERATIONS WE HAD PRESENTLY, AND

6401
04:16:26,304 --> 04:16:30,174
THAT'S ONE CASE WHERE A CERTAIN 

6402
04:16:28,339 --> 04:16:32,476
AMOUNT OF CENTRALIZATION, AT 

6403
04:16:30,241 --> 04:16:33,377
LEAST IN CERTAIN ASPECTS OF IT, 

6404
04:16:32,543 --> 04:16:36,547
COULD SAVE REAL MONEY.

6405
04:16:33,444 --> 04:16:40,584
I MEAN, WE FOUND INEFFICIENCIES,

6406
04:16:36,614 --> 04:16:42,119
AND LIKE I SAY, WE PROBABLY 

6407
04:16:40,651 --> 04:16:43,120
SAVED MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO 

6408
04:16:42,186 --> 04:16:44,522
PARTNERS, BECAUSE THEY KNEW 

6409
04:16:43,187 --> 04:16:47,859
THEIR SITUATION BETTER.

6410
04:16:44,589 --> 04:16:48,159
WE FOUND SOME DUMB THINGS WE 

6411
04:16:47,925 --> 04:16:49,693
WERE DOING.

6412
04:16:48,226 --> 04:16:54,531
SO WE GOT OUR MONEY'S WORTH, BUT

6413
04:16:49,760 --> 04:16:58,169
IN TERMS OF THE BIG PICTURE OF 

6414
04:16:54,598 --> 04:17:00,704
CHANGING SOMETHING, THAT SO MANY

6415
04:16:58,236 --> 04:17:03,774
PEOPLE HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN

6416
04:17:00,771 --> 04:17:07,044
DOING AND THERE'S ONE ADDITIONAL

6417
04:17:03,841 --> 04:17:07,511
FACTOR TO IT WHICH IS REALLY 

6418
04:17:07,111 --> 04:17:10,147
INTERESTING.

6419
04:17:07,578 --> 04:17:13,417
THERE'S AN INGENIUS ASPECT TO IT

6420
04:17:10,213 --> 04:17:15,953
AND IT GOES BACK TO A FELLOW 

6421
04:17:13,484 --> 04:17:18,756
NAMED -- WHICH DOESN'T HAVE ANY 

6422
04:17:16,019 --> 04:17:19,323
DIRECT CONNECTION, BUT BEARDSLY 

6423
04:17:18,823 --> 04:17:23,127
RUMLE.

6424
04:17:19,390 --> 04:17:24,828
NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF BEARDSLY 

6425
04:17:23,194 --> 04:17:26,497
RUMMEL, SO HE CAME UP WITH THE 

6426
04:17:24,895 --> 04:17:29,500
IDEA OF THE HOLDING ATTACKS.

6427
04:17:26,564 --> 04:17:31,602
INSAID TO OF APRIL 15th PEOPLE 

6428
04:17:29,567 --> 04:17:33,337
HAVING TO WRITE A CHECK AND 

6429
04:17:31,669 --> 04:17:35,206
THINKING OF HOW THEY HATED THEIR

6430
04:17:33,404 --> 04:17:37,641
GOVERNMENT, THEY LOOKED AT IT AS

6431
04:17:35,273 --> 04:17:39,510
A CHRISTMAS CLUB, THEY GOT A 

6432
04:17:37,708 --> 04:17:40,211
CHECK WHEN THE FINAL PAYMENT 

6433
04:17:39,576 --> 04:17:42,079
CAME DUE.

6434
04:17:40,278 --> 04:17:43,714
SO WHEN YOU AREN'T WRITING THE 

6435
04:17:42,146 --> 04:17:45,182
CHECK YOURSELF, YOU MAY KNOW 

6436
04:17:43,781 --> 04:17:47,451
THAT THE HEALTH BENEFIT FROM 

6437
04:17:45,249 --> 04:17:51,154
YOUR COMPANY IS WORTH $10,000 A 

6438
04:17:47,518 --> 04:17:53,223
YEAR TO YOU OR $15,000 AND MAY 

6439
04:17:51,221 --> 04:17:54,391
COST THEM THAT MUCH, BUT IT MAY 

6440
04:17:53,290 --> 04:17:56,026
COST THE COMPANY THAT MUCH, BUT 

6441
04:17:54,458 --> 04:17:57,728
YOU DON'T SEE IT.

6442
04:17:56,093 --> 04:17:59,029
SO THE COMPANY PAYS IT, AND MOST

6443
04:17:57,795 --> 04:18:00,965
OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT WAITING 

6444
04:17:59,096 --> 04:18:03,066
ROOM SITTING NEXT TO ME, THEY 

6445
04:18:01,032 --> 04:18:07,805
ARE NOT SITTING THERE THINKING 

6446
04:18:03,133 --> 04:18:08,472
ABOUT WHETHER I CAN AFFORD TO DO

6447
04:18:07,872 --> 04:18:09,640
THIS, YOU KNOW, OR WHAT'S THIS 

6448
04:18:08,539 --> 04:18:11,074
GOING TO DO?

6449
04:18:09,707 --> 04:18:13,276
THEY'RE GENERALLY UNDER SOME 

6450
04:18:11,141 --> 04:18:14,845
KIND OF A PLAN.

6451
04:18:13,343 --> 04:18:16,513
NOT ALWAYS, OBVIOUSLY, BUT THEY 

6452
04:18:14,912 --> 04:18:19,350
DON'T THINK IF THE COMPANY 

6453
04:18:16,580 --> 04:18:21,619
WASN'T PAYING THEM THAT THEY 

6454
04:18:19,417 --> 04:18:22,553
COULD PAY THAT IN ADDITIONAL 

6455
04:18:21,685 --> 04:18:23,520
COMPENSATION.

6456
04:18:22,620 --> 04:18:25,889
BUT OF COURSE THE WEIRD SYSTEM 

6457
04:18:23,587 --> 04:18:28,859
IS THE COMPANY GETS A DEDUCTION 

6458
04:18:25,956 --> 04:18:29,526
IF THEY PAY IT, BUT IF YOU PAY 

6459
04:18:28,926 --> 04:18:31,529
IT YOURSELF ON A POLICY I DON'T 

6460
04:18:29,593 --> 04:18:35,466
BELIEVE YOU GET A DEDUCTION.

6461
04:18:31,596 --> 04:18:37,568
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S -- MOST

6462
04:18:35,533 --> 04:18:39,303
OF THE PEOPLE ARE NOT SEEING AS 

6463
04:18:37,635 --> 04:18:39,704
A COST TO THEM, AND THEY LIKE 

6464
04:18:39,370 --> 04:18:44,608
THAT PRETTY WELL.

6465
04:18:39,770 --> 04:18:46,477
>> NO KIDDING.

6466
04:18:44,675 --> 04:18:48,245
>> WELL, BUT THAT'S TRUE.

6467
04:18:46,544 --> 04:18:51,916
THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX WAS AN 

6468
04:18:48,312 --> 04:18:52,449
ACT OF GENIUS FROM THE 

6469
04:18:51,982 --> 04:18:54,218
GOVERNMENT TO GO TO A 

6470
04:18:52,516 --> 04:18:55,319
WITHHOLDING SYSTEM, AND IF YOU 

6471
04:18:54,285 --> 04:18:57,120
DIDN'T, JUST THINK ABOUT HOW 

6472
04:18:55,386 --> 04:19:00,190
MANY PEOPLE ON APRIL 15th WOULD 

6473
04:18:57,187 --> 04:19:01,659
HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND WRITE A 

6474
04:19:00,257 --> 04:19:02,426
PRETTY GOOD SIZE CHECK AND THEY 

6475
04:19:01,726 --> 04:19:07,765
WOULD BE MAD.

6476
04:19:02,493 --> 04:19:09,533
AND THEY DON'T FEEL IT NOW.

6477
04:19:07,832 --> 04:19:13,937
SO WE WERE UP -- THAT'S AN 

6478
04:19:09,600 --> 04:19:15,940
OBVIOUS POINT, BUT YOU ALSO -- 

6479
04:19:14,004 --> 04:19:17,274
PEOPLE LIKE THEIR DOCTOR IN 

6480
04:19:16,007 --> 04:19:20,711
GENERAL, AND THEY DON'T LIKE THE

6481
04:19:17,341 --> 04:19:25,983
FACT THAT IT'S 17% OF GDP, BUT 

6482
04:19:20,778 --> 04:19:27,718
ONE IS JUST KIND OF AN AMORPHUS 

6483
04:19:26,050 --> 04:19:29,486
THING AND THE OTHER IS PRETTY 

6484
04:19:27,785 --> 04:19:30,488
ISRAEL AND THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS 

6485
04:19:29,553 --> 04:19:31,855
PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE ON 

6486
04:19:30,554 --> 04:19:34,157
THE HOSPITAL BOARDS.

6487
04:19:31,922 --> 04:19:36,760
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE FAIRLY 

6488
04:19:34,224 --> 04:19:39,697
HAPPY WITH THE SYSTEM, SO WE DID

6489
04:19:36,827 --> 04:19:45,869
NOT MAKE INROADS ON THAT, AND WE

6490
04:19:39,763 --> 04:19:47,237
ARE PAYING 17% OF GDP PER HEALTH

6491
04:19:45,936 --> 04:19:49,540
CARE, AND NO MAJOR COUNTRY IS 

6492
04:19:47,304 --> 04:19:52,909
MORE THAN 11%, AND IN THE 

6493
04:19:49,607 --> 04:19:55,079
PANDEMIC, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HAD 

6494
04:19:52,976 --> 04:19:56,780
A DEATH RATE -- OR A DEATH 

6495
04:19:55,146 --> 04:19:57,781
TOTAL, AS A PERCENTAGE OF 

6496
04:19:56,847 --> 04:19:59,049
POPULATION, THAT'S WAY HIGHER 

6497
04:19:57,848 --> 04:20:00,684
THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD.

6498
04:19:59,116 --> 04:20:05,689
NOT EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY, BUT 

6499
04:20:00,751 --> 04:20:06,089
WAY HIGHER.

6500
04:20:05,756 --> 04:20:09,259
SO

6501
04:20:06,156 --> 04:20:10,761
SO, YOU KNOW, WE'VE LAID OUT 

6502
04:20:09,326 --> 04:20:12,896
MORE MONEY AND GOT A WORST 

6503
04:20:10,828 --> 04:20:13,564
RESULT IN TERPS OF THIS 

6504
04:20:12,963 --> 04:20:15,699
PARTICULAR PANDEMIC. 

6505
04:20:13,630 --> 04:20:17,167
>> EVEN THOUGH YOU SHOT AND 

6506
04:20:15,766 --> 04:20:19,169
MISSED, YOU WERE AT LEAST 

6507
04:20:17,234 --> 04:20:21,171
SHOOTING AT AN ELEPHANT.

6508
04:20:19,236 --> 04:20:24,941
THE COST OF HEALTH CARE IN 

6509
04:20:21,238 --> 04:20:26,309
SINGAPORE IS 20% OF WHAT IT IS 

6510
04:20:25,008 --> 04:20:29,480
IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THEIR 

6511
04:20:26,376 --> 04:20:32,983
MEDICAL SYSTEM WORKS BETTER.

6512
04:20:29,547 --> 04:20:33,584
SO YOU WERE AT SHOOTING AT A HU 

6513
04:20:33,050 --> 04:20:36,854
ELEPHANT. 

6514
04:20:33,651 --> 04:20:38,288
>> BUT AS YOU FOUND OUT, IT'S 

6515
04:20:36,921 --> 04:20:40,257
HARD TO GET ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT 

6516
04:20:38,355 --> 04:20:40,490
PEOPLE LOSING PART OF THEIR 

6517
04:20:40,324 --> 04:20:42,592
INCOME. 

6518
04:20:40,557 --> 04:20:44,895
>> I SAID WE WERE FINDING A 

6519
04:20:42,659 --> 04:20:45,963
TAPEWORM IN THE AMERICAN 

6520
04:20:44,962 --> 04:20:47,030
ECONOMY, AND THE TAPEWORM WON. 

6521
04:20:46,030 --> 04:20:47,397
>> THAT'S EXACTLY IT.

6522
04:20:47,097 --> 04:20:49,633
WONDERFUL PHRASE

6523
04:20:47,464 --> 04:20:50,901
TAPEWORM.

6524
04:20:49,700 --> 04:20:52,770
I'LL HAVE TO COPY THAT. 

6525
04:20:50,968 --> 04:20:57,775
>> WELL, IT WASN'T A PHRASE WE 

6526
04:20:52,836 --> 04:21:00,043
WERE LOOKING FOR.

6527
04:20:57,842 --> 04:21:02,546
>> THIS QUESTION COMES IN FROM 

6528
04:21:00,110 --> 04:21:04,715
MARK BLINKLY IN TULSA.

6529
04:21:02,613 --> 04:21:06,850
THIS IS FOR WARREN AND CHARLIE.

6530
04:21:04,782 --> 04:21:08,318
WHEN WE DISCUSS BERKSHIRE WE 

6531
04:21:06,917 --> 04:21:09,787
OFTEN FOCUS ON THE INSURANCE 

6532
04:21:08,385 --> 04:21:10,554
OPERATIONS AND THE LARGEST 

6533
04:21:09,854 --> 04:21:14,491
NONINSURANCE BUSINESSES.

6534
04:21:10,621 --> 04:21:14,691
THE REDWOODS AS YOU MENTIONED IN

6535
04:21:14,558 --> 04:21:16,393
2019.

6536
04:21:14,758 --> 04:21:18,629
HOWEVER, BERKSHIRE OWNS A LARGE 

6537
04:21:16,460 --> 04:21:20,497
NUMBER OF SUBSIDIARY BUSINESSES,

6538
04:21:18,696 --> 04:21:20,764
MOST OF WHICH ARE NEVER 

6539
04:21:20,564 --> 04:21:22,899
MENTIONED.

6540
04:21:20,831 --> 04:21:25,803
IS THERE A POINT AT WHICH IT 

6541
04:21:22,966 --> 04:21:27,203
BECOMES TOO HARD TO MANAGE AND 

6542
04:21:25,870 --> 04:21:28,572
SHOULD -- A LACK OF INFORMATION 

6543
04:21:27,270 --> 04:21:30,474
FOR MOST COMPANIES?

6544
04:21:28,639 --> 04:21:32,609
IS THERE A TIME WHEN BERKSHIRE 

6545
04:21:30,541 --> 04:21:34,778
IS TOO LARGE AND TOO COMPLEX?

6546
04:21:32,676 --> 04:21:35,011
>> IT'S TOO LARGE TO DO CERTAIN 

6547
04:21:34,845 --> 04:21:36,080
THINGS.

6548
04:21:35,078 --> 04:21:40,517
THAT'S FOR SURE.

6549
04:21:36,147 --> 04:21:43,520
WE CAN'T SPEND OUR TIME LOOKING 

6550
04:21:40,584 --> 04:21:45,856
FOR $100 MILLION ACQUISITIONS.

6551
04:21:43,587 --> 04:21:48,926
BUT WE HAVE A WONDERFUL COMPANY 

6552
04:21:45,923 --> 04:21:49,460
IN FT. WORTH, AND WE HAD A 

6553
04:21:48,993 --> 04:21:55,399
MARVELOUS MAN RUNNING IT.

6554
04:21:49,526 --> 04:21:58,001
HE DIED RECENTLY.

6555
04:21:55,466 --> 04:21:58,168
BUT HE RAN IT UNTIL 15 YEARS 

6556
04:21:58,068 --> 04:22:01,539
AGO.

6557
04:21:58,234 --> 04:22:03,207
HE JUST BASICALLY RAN IT.

6558
04:22:01,605 --> 04:22:03,607
I COULDN'T FIND MY WAY TO THE 

6559
04:22:03,274 --> 04:22:06,743
COMPANY.

6560
04:22:03,674 --> 04:22:10,414
WE'VE GOT THIS TERRIFIC COMPANY 

6561
04:22:06,810 --> 04:22:12,683
THAT MAKES RECREATIONAL VEHICLES

6562
04:22:10,481 --> 04:22:14,418
BASED IN INDIANA, AND WE BOUGHT 

6563
04:22:12,749 --> 04:22:15,686
IT 15 YEARS AGO.

6564
04:22:14,485 --> 04:22:16,987
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.

6565
04:22:15,753 --> 04:22:18,589
MAYBE THERE'S SOME KIND OF 

6566
04:22:17,054 --> 04:22:21,558
CLOSET MAKING UP NUMBERS TO SEND

6567
04:22:18,656 --> 04:22:22,592
TO ME, BUT I FEEL I UNDERSTAND 

6568
04:22:21,625 --> 04:22:24,027
THE BUSINESS PRETTY WELL, BUT 

6569
04:22:22,659 --> 04:22:26,363
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT AND THE 

6570
04:22:24,094 --> 04:22:29,432
FELLOW THAT RUNS IT LIKES 

6571
04:22:26,430 --> 04:22:29,833
RUNNING IT AND LIKES ME KEEPING 

6572
04:22:29,499 --> 04:22:31,101
MY NOSE OUT OF IT.

6573
04:22:29,899 --> 04:22:34,404
HE'LL LET GREG IN A LITTLE MORE 

6574
04:22:31,168 --> 04:22:36,106
THAN HE'LL LET ME.

6575
04:22:34,471 --> 04:22:37,574
BUT WE'VE GOT A SYSTEM THAT WILL

6576
04:22:36,173 --> 04:22:39,143
WORK WITH WONDERFUL BUSINESSES 

6577
04:22:37,641 --> 04:22:42,679
AND WONDERFUL MANAGERS.

6578
04:22:39,209 --> 04:22:45,215
AND IT'S UP TO US TO FIND THEM.

6579
04:22:42,746 --> 04:22:47,351
BUT IT'S ALSO US TO NURTURE THEM

6580
04:22:45,282 --> 04:22:49,986
WHEN WE FIND THEM.

6581
04:22:47,418 --> 04:22:55,292
AND IF YOU'LL GET SOMEBODY LIKE 

6582
04:22:50,053 --> 04:22:57,727
PAUL ANDREWS WHO RAN TTI AND WHO

6583
04:22:55,359 --> 04:22:59,095
BUILT IT FROM NOTHING, 

6584
04:22:57,794 --> 04:23:03,300
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, AND NOBODY 

6585
04:22:59,162 --> 04:23:07,237
EVER HEARD OF HIM, AND THE 

6586
04:23:03,367 --> 04:23:10,574
EARNINGS HAVE OCTUPLED DURING 

6587
04:23:07,304 --> 04:23:11,875
THE PERIOD HE RAN IT FOR US.

6588
04:23:10,641 --> 04:23:12,108
HE WAS HAPPY, THE EMPLOYEES WERE

6589
04:23:11,942 --> 04:23:13,610
HAPPY.

6590
04:23:12,175 --> 04:23:14,244
HE WAS A WONDERFUL MAN.

6591
04:23:13,677 --> 04:23:15,446
WE WERE HAPPY.

6592
04:23:14,311 --> 04:23:18,181
AND I'D CALL HIM AT THE END OF 

6593
04:23:15,512 --> 04:23:21,184
THE YEAR AND SAY, PAUL, THIS 

6594
04:23:18,248 --> 04:23:21,919
PLACE IS -- YOU'RE SHOOTING THE 

6595
04:23:21,251 --> 04:23:23,887
LIGHTS OUT.

6596
04:23:21,986 --> 04:23:24,087
YOU SHOULD TAKE A RAISE OR A 

6597
04:23:23,954 --> 04:23:25,989
BONUS.

6598
04:23:24,154 --> 04:23:26,657
HE'D SAY, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT 

6599
04:23:26,056 --> 04:23:27,925
NEXT YEAR.

6600
04:23:26,724 --> 04:23:28,926
HE JUST LOVED THE BUSINESS.

6601
04:23:27,992 --> 04:23:30,694
I LOVED BERKSHIRE.

6602
04:23:28,992 --> 04:23:32,996
HE LOVED THE BUSINESS.

6603
04:23:30,761 --> 04:23:34,397
AND I WASN'T GOING TO ADD 

6604
04:23:33,063 --> 04:23:36,633
ANYTHING BY HAVING HIM FILL OUT 

6605
04:23:34,464 --> 04:23:39,369
A BUNCH OF REPORTS ABOUT HOW 

6606
04:23:36,700 --> 04:23:41,738
MUCH HE'S USING IN THE WAY OF 

6607
04:23:39,436 --> 04:23:43,607
CARBON OR THE -- YOU KNOW, IT'S 

6608
04:23:41,805 --> 04:23:46,076
JUST RIDICULOUS THINK OF A GUY 

6609
04:23:43,674 --> 04:23:47,611
LIKE PAUL ANDREWS BEHAVING IN AN

6610
04:23:46,143 --> 04:23:50,581
ANTI-SOCIAL MANNER OF ANYTHING 

6611
04:23:47,678 --> 04:23:54,718
OF THE SORT.

6612
04:23:50,648 --> 04:23:56,520
AND WE'D LOVE TO HAVE MORE OF 

6613
04:23:54,785 --> 04:23:57,988
THOSE, AND OBVIOUSLY WE GOT 

6614
04:23:56,587 --> 04:24:00,157
BIGGER, THEY GET HARDER TO BUY.

6615
04:23:58,055 --> 04:24:01,992
BUT WE'VE GOT A NUMBER IN THE 

6616
04:24:00,224 --> 04:24:04,127
PLACE, AND I DON'T THINK WE 

6617
04:24:02,059 --> 04:24:05,829
BOUGHT OUR LAST ONE OVER TIME, 

6618
04:24:04,194 --> 04:24:09,333
BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T SEE 

6619
04:24:05,896 --> 04:24:09,500
ANYTHING IN THE NEAR FUTURE AT 

6620
04:24:09,400 --> 04:24:14,404
ALL.

6621
04:24:09,566 --> 04:24:16,273
BUT WE'RE INTENSIFYING OUR 

6622
04:24:14,471 --> 04:24:18,208
INTEREST IN PURCHASING SHARES.

6623
04:24:16,340 --> 04:24:20,610
OUR SHAREHOLDERS OWN MORE IN THE

6624
04:24:18,275 --> 04:24:23,280
COMPANIES EVERY YEAR, ASSUMING 

6625
04:24:20,677 --> 04:24:24,614
WE'RE REPURCHASING SHARES, WHICH

6626
04:24:23,347 --> 04:24:25,249
IS PRICE SENSITIVE. 

6627
04:24:24,681 --> 04:24:27,884
>> CHARLIE?

6628
04:24:25,316 --> 04:24:29,552
>> YEAH, I DON'T THINK WE'RE 

6629
04:24:27,951 --> 04:24:32,322
GETTING TOO BIG TO MANAGE, 

6630
04:24:29,619 --> 04:24:33,390
BECAUSE WE'RE DIFFERENT FROM 

6631
04:24:32,389 --> 04:24:34,124
PRACTICALLY EVER OTHER 

6632
04:24:33,457 --> 04:24:42,132
CORPORATION IN THE UNITED STATES

6633
04:24:34,191 --> 04:24:42,466
IN THAT WE ARE SO EXCESSIVELY 

6634
04:24:42,199 --> 04:24:44,868
DECENTRALIZED.

6635
04:24:42,532 --> 04:24:47,103
WE HAVE DECENTRALIZED SO MUCH 

6636
04:24:44,934 --> 04:24:47,938
AND SO MUCH AUTHORITY IN THE 

6637
04:24:47,170 --> 04:24:49,773
SUBSIDIARIES THAT WE CAN KEEP 

6638
04:24:48,005 --> 04:24:51,575
DOING IT FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, 

6639
04:24:49,840 --> 04:25:00,751
AS LONG AS IT KEEPS WORKING.

6640
04:24:51,641 --> 04:25:02,419
I WOULD SAY SO FAR OUR DECENT 

6641
04:25:00,818 --> 04:25:11,594
RALIZATION HAS -- THAT'S TRUE, 

6642
04:25:02,486 --> 04:25:13,263
BUT I CAN SAY THIS, DECENT RAL 

6643
04:25:11,661 --> 04:25:14,631
IZATION WON'T WORK IF YOU DON'T 

6644
04:25:13,330 --> 04:25:16,499
HAVE TO RIGHT CULTURE. 

6645
04:25:14,697 --> 04:25:18,168
>> YEAH, BUT WE DO, AND GREG 

6646
04:25:16,566 --> 04:25:18,435
WILL KEEP WORKING ON THE 

6647
04:25:18,235 --> 04:25:21,371
CULTURE. 

6648
04:25:18,502 --> 04:25:22,839
>> IF WE HAD A CULTURE OF PEOPLE

6649
04:25:21,438 --> 04:25:25,976
TRYING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY 

6650
04:25:22,906 --> 04:25:27,143
FOR THEMSELVES IN THE NEXT FIVE 

6651
04:25:26,043 --> 04:25:27,944
YEARS AT THE TOP, I WOULD NOT 

6652
04:25:27,210 --> 04:25:29,346
HAVE WORKED. 

6653
04:25:28,011 --> 04:25:31,148
>> NO, OF COURSE NOT.

6654
04:25:29,412 --> 04:25:34,218
THE CULTURE IS PART OF IT.

6655
04:25:31,215 --> 04:25:36,219
ASSUMING WE KEEP THE CULTURE, 

6656
04:25:34,284 --> 04:25:39,623
THE GO ON A QUITE A WAYS.

6657
04:25:36,286 --> 04:25:40,290
LONG, LONG TIME.

6658
04:25:39,690 --> 04:25:43,059
I THINK IT WILL AMAZE EVERYBODY.

6659
04:25:40,357 --> 04:25:45,729
BY THE WAY, THE ROMAN EMPIRE 

6660
04:25:43,126 --> 04:25:48,932
WORKED AS LONG AS IT DID BECAUSE

6661
04:25:45,796 --> 04:25:51,768
IT WAS SO DECENTRALIZED. 

6662
04:25:48,999 --> 04:25:52,001
>> AS CHARLIE SAID, WE WON'T 

6663
04:25:51,835 --> 04:25:54,471
KNOW. 

6664
04:25:52,068 --> 04:25:55,005
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM 

6665
04:25:54,538 --> 04:25:56,640
KEVIN YOUNG.

6666
04:25:55,072 --> 04:25:58,775
IT'S FOR AJIT AND GREG.

6667
04:25:56,707 --> 04:26:01,778
WARREN SPENDS THE DAY READING 

6668
04:25:58,841 --> 04:26:02,012
AND HIS WORK OF CHOICE IS ANNUAL

6669
04:26:01,845 --> 04:26:05,315
REPORTS.

6670
04:26:02,079 --> 04:26:05,916
HOW DO EACH OF YOU SPEND YOUR 

6671
04:26:05,381 --> 04:26:08,251
DAYS?

6672
04:26:05,983 --> 04:26:09,886
WHAT DO YOU READ AND HOW DO YOU 

6673
04:26:08,318 --> 04:26:12,456
REACH INVESTMENT DECISIONS?

6674
04:26:09,953 --> 04:26:14,924
>> WELL, IN MY JOB I SPEND A LOT

6675
04:26:12,523 --> 04:26:19,029
OF MY TIME READING DEALS THAT 

6676
04:26:14,991 --> 04:26:21,164
BROKERS AND PEOPLE SEND US.

6677
04:26:19,096 --> 04:26:22,532
READING WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING, 

6678
04:26:21,231 --> 04:26:24,101
TRYING TO ANALYZE THEM, HAVING A

6679
04:26:22,599 --> 04:26:25,335
POINT OF VIEW.

6680
04:26:24,168 --> 04:26:26,370
IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS OF 

6681
04:26:25,402 --> 04:26:28,338
INTEREST TO US OR NOT.

6682
04:26:26,437 --> 04:26:29,706
I MIGHT ADD, I DO NOT SPEND A 

6683
04:26:28,405 --> 04:26:32,809
LOT OF TIME READING REPORTS 

6684
04:26:29,773 --> 04:26:35,512
BECAUSE I'M NOT IN THE STOCK 

6685
04:26:32,876 --> 04:26:38,782
MAKING BUSINESS PER SE.

6686
04:26:35,579 --> 04:26:41,018
BUT IN TERMS OF KEEPING TRACK OF

6687
04:26:38,849 --> 04:26:43,920
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE INSURANCE

6688
04:26:41,085 --> 04:26:45,389
BUSINESS, THAT'S WHAT 90% OF MY 

6689
04:26:43,987 --> 04:26:45,589
READING IS ABOUT.

6690
04:26:45,456 --> 04:26:46,356
GREG?

6691
04:26:45,656 --> 04:26:47,958
>> YEAH.

6692
04:26:46,423 --> 04:26:49,325
SO GENERALLY TODAY WHAT I FOCUS 

6693
04:26:48,024 --> 04:26:50,961
ON WHEN READING IS REALLY AROUND

6694
04:26:49,392 --> 04:26:54,197
OUR BUSINESSES.

6695
04:26:51,028 --> 04:26:56,199
WHAT INDUSTRIES ARE IN.

6696
04:26:54,264 --> 04:26:57,400
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR 

6697
04:26:56,266 --> 04:26:58,735
COMPETITORS ARE DOING, WHAT'S 

6698
04:26:57,467 --> 04:27:00,403
THE RISK AROUND THE BUSINESSES, 

6699
04:26:58,802 --> 04:27:02,272
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET 

6700
04:27:00,470 --> 04:27:05,108
DISRUPTED AND IT ALWAYS COMES 

6701
04:27:02,339 --> 04:27:06,877
BACK TO, ARE WE ALLOCATING 

6702
04:27:05,175 --> 04:27:08,411
CAPITAL CORRECTLY RELATIVE TO 

6703
04:27:06,943 --> 04:27:10,180
THE RISKS WE'RE SEEING BOTH IN 

6704
04:27:08,478 --> 04:27:12,816
BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY?

6705
04:27:10,247 --> 04:27:14,117
SO, A LOT OF TIME SPENT ON THAT 

6706
04:27:12,883 --> 04:27:16,119
AND AS THAT KNOWLEDGE IS BUILT 

6707
04:27:14,184 --> 04:27:17,821
IT'S SHARING IT BACK AND FORTH 

6708
04:27:16,186 --> 04:27:19,156
WITH MANAGEMENT TEAMS WITH 

6709
04:27:17,888 --> 04:27:21,124
RELATIVE SUBSIDIARIES AND SORT 

6710
04:27:19,222 --> 04:27:21,391
OF FINE TUNING IT IS REALLY THE 

6711
04:27:21,191 --> 04:27:24,360
APPROACH. 

6712
04:27:21,458 --> 04:27:26,629
>> BOTH OF THESE FELLOWS CAN 

6713
04:27:24,427 --> 04:27:27,330
ABSORB INFORMATION TO AN 

6714
04:27:26,696 --> 04:27:31,568
EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE.

6715
04:27:27,397 --> 04:27:32,702
I MEAN, THEY HAVE -- FOR ONE 

6716
04:27:31,635 --> 04:27:34,138
THING, THEY'RE TERRIBLY 

6717
04:27:32,769 --> 04:27:37,807
INTERESTED IN IT.

6718
04:27:34,204 --> 04:27:40,544
AND IT'S THEIRS.

6719
04:27:37,874 --> 04:27:42,245
SO I'M AMAZED AT BOTH OF THEM, 

6720
04:27:40,611 --> 04:27:45,148
THE DEGREE WITH WHICH THEY SORT 

6721
04:27:42,312 --> 04:27:46,716
OF KNOW EVERYTHING.

6722
04:27:45,215 --> 04:27:49,753
AND -- BUT THEY ENJOY IT.

6723
04:27:46,783 --> 04:27:50,520
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT 

6724
04:27:49,820 --> 04:27:52,622
WHETHER THEY'LL GET THE NEXT JOB

6725
04:27:50,587 --> 04:27:54,291
THAT OPENS UP AT SOME HUGE MACE 

6726
04:27:52,689 --> 04:27:57,027
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

6727
04:27:54,358 --> 04:28:01,698
NOBODY LEAVES US, BASICALLY.

6728
04:27:57,094 --> 04:28:04,100
THE ONES WE WANT.

6729
04:28:01,765 --> 04:28:05,635
BUT YOU REALLY GOT TO KIND OF BE

6730
04:28:04,167 --> 04:28:07,470
IN LOVE WITH YOUR BUSINESS, AND 

6731
04:28:05,702 --> 04:28:08,906
THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

6732
04:28:07,537 --> 04:28:11,674
THAT MEANS THAT WE'VE GOT TO 

6733
04:28:08,972 --> 04:28:14,878
HAVE THE CONDITIONS THAT ALLOW 

6734
04:28:11,741 --> 04:28:17,247
THAT LOVE TO FLOURISH.

6735
04:28:14,945 --> 04:28:20,550
AND IT WOULDN'T FLOURISH UNDER 

6736
04:28:17,314 --> 04:28:22,252
MANY -- WITH MANY ORGANIZATIONS.

6737
04:28:20,617 --> 04:28:23,687
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM 

6738
04:28:22,319 --> 04:28:25,088
ROBERT MILES IN NEBRASKA.

6739
04:28:23,754 --> 04:28:27,791
THE TRADING APPS, WHAT DO YOU 

6740
04:28:25,155 --> 04:28:29,692
THINK ABOUT ROBIN HOOD AND OTHER

6741
04:28:27,858 --> 04:28:33,497
TRADING APPS OR FIN TECH 

6742
04:28:29,759 --> 04:28:34,397
COMPANIES ALLOWING ALL AGES TO 

6743
04:28:33,564 --> 04:28:36,432
PARTICIPATE IN THE STOCK MARKET?

6744
04:28:34,464 --> 04:28:38,668
>> WELL, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO 

6745
04:28:36,499 --> 04:28:40,670
READING THE S-1 ON ROBIN.

6746
04:28:38,735 --> 04:28:41,905
THAT'S A BIG THING YOU FILE WITH

6747
04:28:40,737 --> 04:28:45,308
THE S.E.C. WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO 

6748
04:28:41,971 --> 04:28:51,881
BE OFFERING SECURITIES.

6749
04:28:45,375 --> 04:28:57,987
AND IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT'S 

6750
04:28:51,948 --> 04:29:01,291
BECOME A VERY SIGNIFICANT PART 

6751
04:28:58,054 --> 04:29:05,962
OF THE CASINO ASPECT, OF THE 

6752
04:29:01,358 --> 04:29:07,564
CASINO GROUP THAT HAS JOINED 

6753
04:29:06,029 --> 04:29:10,700
INTO THE STOCK MARKET IN THE 

6754
04:29:07,631 --> 04:29:14,404
LAST YEAR OR YEAR AND A HALF.

6755
04:29:10,767 --> 04:29:16,073
AND I DO WANT TO SAY I WAS 

6756
04:29:14,471 --> 04:29:17,574
CNCERNED ABOUT HOW THEY HAND IT

6757
04:29:16,139 --> 04:29:19,442
WILL SOURCE OF INCOME.

6758
04:29:17,641 --> 04:29:21,911
THEY SAY THEY DON'T CHARGE THE 

6759
04:29:19,509 --> 04:29:26,416
CUSTOMER OR ANYTHING.

6760
04:29:21,978 --> 04:29:33,823
THIS WILL BE INTERESTING.

6761
04:29:26,483 --> 04:29:36,660
BUT THEY -- THEY -- HAVE 

6762
04:29:33,890 --> 04:29:38,862
ATTRACTED -- MAYBE SET OUT TO 

6763
04:29:36,727 --> 04:29:41,364
ATTRACT, BUT THEY HAVE 

6764
04:29:38,929 --> 04:29:46,002
ATTRACTED -- I THINK I READ 

6765
04:29:41,431 --> 04:29:48,672
WHERE 12% OR 13% OF THEIR CASINO

6766
04:29:46,069 --> 04:29:53,843
PARTICIPANTS WERE DEALING IN -- 

6767
04:29:48,739 --> 04:29:55,045
I LOOKED UP ON APP IT WILL 

6768
04:29:53,910 --> 04:29:57,214
NU -- 

6769
04:29:55,112 --> 04:29:59,316
APPLE, THE NUMBER OF SEVEN-DAY 

6770
04:29:57,281 --> 04:29:59,616
CALLS AND 1446 DAY CALLS 

6771
04:29:59,383 --> 04:30:01,551
OUTSTANDING.

6772
04:29:59,683 --> 04:30:02,352
AND I'M SURE A LOT OF THAT IS ON

6773
04:30:01,618 --> 04:30:04,988
ROBIN HOOD.

6774
04:30:02,419 --> 04:30:05,255
THEY'RE GAMBLING ON THE PRICE OF

6775
04:30:05,055 --> 04:30:06,990
APPLE.

6776
04:30:05,322 --> 04:30:15,799
THERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL ABOUT 

6777
04:30:07,057 --> 04:30:18,101
IT, THERE'S NOTHING IMMORAL, BUT

6778
04:30:15,866 --> 04:30:20,637
I DON'T THINK YOU'D BUILD A 

6779
04:30:18,168 --> 04:30:24,040
SOCIETY AROUND PEOPLE DOING IT.

6780
04:30:20,704 --> 04:30:25,475
IF A GROUP OF US LANDED ON A 

6781
04:30:24,107 --> 04:30:26,909
DESERT ISLAND, KNEW WE WOULD 

6782
04:30:25,542 --> 04:30:28,912
NEVER BE RESCUED AND I WAS ONE 

6783
04:30:26,976 --> 04:30:31,581
OF THE GROUP AND SAID, I'LL SET 

6784
04:30:28,978 --> 04:30:33,182
UP AN EXCHANGE OVER HERE AND 

6785
04:30:31,648 --> 04:30:36,686
I'LL TRADE OUR CORN FUTURES AND 

6786
04:30:33,249 --> 04:30:39,956
EVERYTHING AROUND IT, I THINK 

6787
04:30:36,753 --> 04:30:44,361
THE DEGREE TO WHICH A VERY RICH 

6788
04:30:40,023 --> 04:30:49,098
SOCIETY CAN REWARD PEOPLE WHO 

6789
04:30:44,428 --> 04:30:50,500
KNOW HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE, 

6790
04:30:49,165 --> 04:30:52,035
ESSENTIALLY, OF THE GAMBLING 

6791
04:30:50,567 --> 04:30:54,204
INSTINCTS OF NOT ONLY THE 

6792
04:30:52,102 --> 04:30:56,506
AMERICAN PUBLIC, THE WORLDWIDE 

6793
04:30:54,271 --> 04:30:59,643
PUBLIC, IT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT 

6794
04:30:56,573 --> 04:31:00,010
THE MOST ADMIRABLE PART OF THE 

6795
04:30:59,710 --> 04:31:01,744
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

6796
04:31:00,077 --> 04:31:04,080
BUT I THINK WHAT AMERICANS 

6797
04:31:01,811 --> 04:31:06,049
ACCOMPLISHED IS PRETTY ADMIRABLE

6798
04:31:04,147 --> 04:31:09,252
OVERALL.

6799
04:31:06,116 --> 04:31:10,954
AND I THINK ACTUALLY AMERICAN 

6800
04:31:09,319 --> 04:31:12,922
CORPORATIONS HAVE TURNED OUT TO 

6801
04:31:11,020 --> 04:31:15,358
BE A WONDERFUL PLACE FOR PEOPLE 

6802
04:31:12,989 --> 04:31:17,393
TO PUT THEIR MONEY AND SAVE.

6803
04:31:15,425 --> 04:31:20,597
BUT THEY ALSO MAKE TERRIFIC 

6804
04:31:17,460 --> 04:31:22,665
GAMBLING CHIPS, AND IF YOU CATER

6805
04:31:20,664 --> 04:31:24,067
TO THOSE GAMBLING CHIPS WHEN 

6806
04:31:22,732 --> 04:31:25,601
PEOPLE HAVE MONEY IN THEIR 

6807
04:31:24,134 --> 04:31:28,739
POCKET FOR THE FIRST TIME AND 

6808
04:31:25,668 --> 04:31:34,077
YOU TELL THEM TAKE MY 30 OR 40 

6809
04:31:28,805 --> 04:31:35,978
OR 50 TRADES A DAY AND YOU'RE 

6810
04:31:34,144 --> 04:31:38,281
NOT CHARGING COMMISSION -- I 

6811
04:31:36,045 --> 04:31:39,649
HOPE WE DON'T HAVE MORE OF IT.

6812
04:31:38,347 --> 04:31:40,350
AND I WILL BE INTERESTED IN 

6813
04:31:39,716 --> 04:31:43,586
READING THE PERSPECTIVES.

6814
04:31:40,417 --> 04:31:46,523
CHARLIE?

6815
04:31:43,653 --> 04:31:51,995
>> WELL, THAT IS REALLY WAVING 

6816
04:31:46,590 --> 04:31:53,429
THE RED FLAG AT THE BULL.

6817
04:31:52,062 --> 04:31:56,566
IT'S JUST GOT AWFUL THAT 

6818
04:31:53,496 --> 04:31:57,934
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD DRAW 

6819
04:31:56,633 --> 04:32:00,403
INVESTMENT FROM CIVILIZED MAN 

6820
04:31:58,001 --> 04:32:08,111
AND DECENT CITIZENS.

6821
04:32:00,470 --> 04:32:09,946
IT'S DEEPLY WRONG.

6822
04:32:08,178 --> 04:32:13,817
WE DON'T WANT THE MAKE OUR MONEY

6823
04:32:10,013 --> 04:32:14,050
SELLING THINGS THAT ARE BAD FOR 

6824
04:32:13,884 --> 04:32:16,953
PEOPLE. 

6825
04:32:14,117 --> 04:32:18,088
>> BUT WE'VE GOT THE STATE DOING

6826
04:32:17,020 --> 04:32:19,322
IT WITH THE LOTTERY. 

6827
04:32:18,154 --> 04:32:20,190
>> BUT THAT'S BAD, TOO.

6828
04:32:19,389 --> 04:32:20,924
THAT'S VERY BAD.

6829
04:32:20,257 --> 04:32:22,592
THAT'S VERY BAD.

6830
04:32:20,991 --> 04:32:24,060
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S 

6831
04:32:22,659 --> 04:32:26,996
WRONG WITH IT -- IT'S GETTING 

6832
04:32:24,126 --> 04:32:29,298
RESPECTABLE TO DO THESE THINGS.

6833
04:32:27,063 --> 04:32:29,632
THE STATES ARE JUST AS BAD AS 

6834
04:32:29,365 --> 04:32:31,368
ROBIN HOOD. 

6835
04:32:29,699 --> 04:32:31,768
>> WELL, IN A SENSE THEY'RE 

6836
04:32:31,435 --> 04:32:34,704
WORSE.

6837
04:32:31,835 --> 04:32:36,339
I MEAN, THEY'RE REALLY TAXING. 

6838
04:32:34,771 --> 04:32:36,539
>> I KNOW IT'S -- I KNOW, I 

6839
04:32:36,405 --> 04:32:40,009
KNOW. 

6840
04:32:36,606 --> 04:32:42,278
>> THEY'RE TAXING HOPE.

6841
04:32:40,076 --> 04:32:44,848
>> NOT ONLY THAT -- 

6842
04:32:42,345 --> 04:32:46,148
>> AND THEY DON'T GET MUCH IN 

6843
04:32:44,914 --> 04:32:47,884
THE WAY OF TAXES. 

6844
04:32:46,215 --> 04:32:54,924
>> THE STATES IN AMERICA 

6845
04:32:47,951 --> 04:32:56,259
REPLACED THE MAFIA AS THE P

6846
04:32:54,991 --> 04:32:56,960
PROPRIETOR OF THE NUMBERS GAME.

6847
04:32:56,326 --> 04:33:00,697
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

6848
04:32:57,027 --> 04:33:03,833
THEY PUSHED THE MAFIA ASIDE AND 

6849
04:33:00,764 --> 04:33:04,100
SAID, THAT'S OUR BUSINESS, NOT 

6850
04:33:03,900 --> 04:33:05,969
YOURS.

6851
04:33:04,167 --> 04:33:06,269
DOESN'T MAKE ME PROUD OF OUR 

6852
04:33:06,036 --> 04:33:08,538
GOVERNMENT. 

6853
04:33:06,336 --> 04:33:11,908
>> WHEN I WAS A KID BY DAD WAS 

6854
04:33:08,605 --> 04:33:14,577
IN CONGRESS AND THEY HAD A 

6855
04:33:11,975 --> 04:33:18,515
NUMBERS RUNNER IN THE OFFICE. 

6856
04:33:14,644 --> 04:33:22,218
>> I WILL ASK THE QUESTION.

6857
04:33:18,582 --> 04:33:23,653
FROM RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES BY 

6858
04:33:22,285 --> 04:33:25,922
BERKSHIRE SUBSIDIARIES ARE YOU 

6859
04:33:23,720 --> 04:33:26,422
SEEING SIGNS OF INFLATION 

6860
04:33:25,989 --> 04:33:28,758
BEGINNING TO INCREASE?

6861
04:33:26,489 --> 04:33:32,028
>> LET ME ANSWER THAT AND THEN 

6862
04:33:28,825 --> 04:33:33,897
GREG CAN GET MORE -- WE'RE 

6863
04:33:32,095 --> 04:33:35,198
SEEING SUBSTANTIAL INFLATION.

6864
04:33:33,963 --> 04:33:36,232
IT'S INTERESTING.

6865
04:33:35,265 --> 04:33:39,302
WE'RE RAISING PRICES.

6866
04:33:36,299 --> 04:33:40,870
PEOPLE ARE RAISING PRICES TO US.

6867
04:33:39,369 --> 04:33:46,910
AND IT'S BEING ACCEPTED.

6868
04:33:40,937 --> 04:33:49,045
I MEAN, IT'S NOT -- IF WE GET --

6869
04:33:46,977 --> 04:33:49,312
WELL, YOU KNOW, TAKE-HOME 

6870
04:33:49,112 --> 04:33:53,115
BUILDING.

6871
04:33:49,379 --> 04:33:55,117
THE COST OF -- WE'VE GOT NINE 

6872
04:33:53,182 --> 04:33:56,419
HOME BUILDERS IN ADDITION TO 

6873
04:33:55,184 --> 04:33:57,620
MANUFACTURED HOUSING AND 

6874
04:33:56,486 --> 04:34:00,723
OPERATION WHICH IS THE LARGEST 

6875
04:33:57,687 --> 04:34:01,124
IN THE COUNTRY, SO WE REALLY DO 

6876
04:34:00,790 --> 04:34:05,261
A LOT OF HOUSING.

6877
04:34:01,190 --> 04:34:06,696
THE COSTS ARE JUST UP, UP, UP.

6878
04:34:05,328 --> 04:34:08,131
STEEL COSTS.

6879
04:34:06,763 --> 04:34:11,267
YOU KNOW, JUST EVERY DAY THEY'RE

6880
04:34:08,198 --> 04:34:14,337
GOING UP.

6881
04:34:11,334 --> 04:34:15,905
AND THEY'RE HASN'T YET BEEN, 

6882
04:34:14,404 --> 04:34:20,109
BECAUSE THE WAGE STUFF FOLLOWS.

6883
04:34:15,972 --> 04:34:21,110
I MEAN, IF THE UAW WRITES A 

6884
04:34:20,176 --> 04:34:23,212
THREE-YEAR CONTRACT, YOU'VE GOT 

6885
04:34:21,177 --> 04:34:25,548
A THREE-YEAR CONTRACT, BUT IF 

6886
04:34:23,279 --> 04:34:27,250
YOU'RE BUYING STEEL AT GENERAL 

6887
04:34:25,614 --> 04:34:30,687
MOTORS OR SOME PLACE YOU'RE 

6888
04:34:27,317 --> 04:34:34,657
PAYING MORE EVERY DAY.

6889
04:34:30,754 --> 04:34:36,993
SO IT'S -- IT'S AN ECONOMY 

6890
04:34:34,724 --> 04:34:38,194
REALLY -- IT'S RED-HOT.

6891
04:34:37,060 --> 04:34:42,298
AND WE WEREN'T EXPECTING IT.

6892
04:34:38,261 --> 04:34:46,168
ALL OF COMPANIES THEY THOUGHT 

6893
04:34:42,365 --> 04:34:49,205
WHEN THEY WERE ALLOWED TO GO 

6894
04:34:46,235 --> 04:34:51,107
BACK TO WORK OR OPERATIONS -- 

6895
04:34:49,272 --> 04:34:52,876
WHEN WE CLOSED THE FURNITURE 

6896
04:34:51,174 --> 04:34:54,644
STORES, THEY WERE CLOSED FOR SIX

6897
04:34:52,943 --> 04:34:56,112
WEEKS OR SO ON AVERAGE, AND THEY

6898
04:34:54,711 --> 04:34:58,848
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO 

6899
04:34:56,179 --> 04:35:00,316
HAPPEN WHEN THEY OPENED.

6900
04:34:58,915 --> 04:35:01,951
THEY CAN'T STOP PEOPLE FROM 

6901
04:35:00,383 --> 04:35:03,386
BUYING THINGS.

6902
04:35:02,018 --> 04:35:05,288
AND WE CAN'T DELIVER THEM.

6903
04:35:03,453 --> 04:35:06,689
THEY SAY, THAT'S OKAY, NOBODY 

6904
04:35:05,355 --> 04:35:08,057
ELSE CAN DELIVER THEM EITHER.

6905
04:35:06,756 --> 04:35:09,792
WE WAIT FOR THREE MONTHS.

6906
04:35:08,124 --> 04:35:11,928
THE BACKLOG GROWS.

6907
04:35:09,859 --> 04:35:14,597
AND THEN WE THOUGHT IT WOULD END

6908
04:35:11,995 --> 04:35:16,599
WHEN THE $600 PAYMENTED ENDED.

6909
04:35:14,664 --> 04:35:17,967
AROUND AUGUST OF LAST YEAR.

6910
04:35:16,666 --> 04:35:21,938
JUST KEPT GOING, AND IT KEEPS 

6911
04:35:18,034 --> 04:35:22,138
GOING AND KEEPS GOING AND KEEPS 

6912
04:35:22,005 --> 04:35:22,906
GOING.

6913
04:35:22,205 --> 04:35:25,408
AND I GET THE FIGURES.

6914
04:35:22,973 --> 04:35:28,111
EVERY WEEK I CALL OR HE CALLS ME

6915
04:35:25,475 --> 04:35:29,478
AND WE GO OVER DAY BY DAY WHAT 

6916
04:35:28,178 --> 04:35:30,913
HAPPENED AT THREE DIFFERENT 

6917
04:35:29,545 --> 04:35:31,848
SCORE STORES IN CHICAGO AND 

6918
04:35:30,980 --> 04:35:33,283
KANSAS CITY, AND DALLAS.

6919
04:35:31,915 --> 04:35:35,585
AND IT JUST WON'T STOP.

6920
04:35:33,350 --> 04:35:39,522
PEOPLE HAVE MONEY IN THEIR 

6921
04:35:35,651 --> 04:35:39,923
POCKET, AND THEY PAY HIGHER 

6922
04:35:39,589 --> 04:35:41,958
PRICES.

6923
04:35:39,990 --> 04:35:45,161
AND WHEN CARPET PRICES GO UP IN 

6924
04:35:42,025 --> 04:35:47,130
A MONTH OR TWO, HOUSE PRICE 

6925
04:35:45,228 --> 04:35:47,597
INCREASE, ART COSTS ARE GOING 

6926
04:35:47,197 --> 04:35:49,899
UP.

6927
04:35:47,664 --> 04:35:51,300
SUPPLY CHAINS ALL SCREWED UP FOR

6928
04:35:49,966 --> 04:36:02,378
ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE.

6929
04:35:51,367 --> 04:36:02,978
BUT IT'S ALMOST A BUYING FRIENZ,

6930
04:36:02,445 --> 04:36:03,212
EXCEPT CERTAIN PLACE US CAN'T 

6931
04:36:03,045 --> 04:36:03,779
BUY YET.

6932
04:36:03,279 --> 04:36:04,013
YOU CAN'T BY INTERNATIONAL 

6933
04:36:03,846 --> 04:36:04,713
TRAVEL.

6934
04:36:04,080 --> 04:36:05,581
SO MONEY IS BEING DIVERTED FROM 

6935
04:36:04,780 --> 04:36:08,217
A PIECE OF THE ECONOMY INTO THE 

6936
04:36:05,648 --> 04:36:11,020
REST AND EVERYBODY'S GOT MORE 

6937
04:36:08,284 --> 04:36:14,023
CASH IN THEIR POCKET, EXCEPT FOR

6938
04:36:11,087 --> 04:36:15,825
MEANWHILE, YOU KNOW, IT'S A 

6939
04:36:14,090 --> 04:36:16,626
TERRIBLE SITUATION FOR A 

6940
04:36:15,892 --> 04:36:18,394
PERCENTAGE OF THE PEOPLE.

6941
04:36:16,693 --> 04:36:20,429
YOU KNOW, THIS SUIT -- I HAVEN'T

6942
04:36:18,461 --> 04:36:22,498
WORN A SUIT, YOU KNOW, FOR A 

6943
04:36:20,496 --> 04:36:24,800
YEAR PRACTICALLY, AND THAT MEANS

6944
04:36:22,565 --> 04:36:26,269
THAT THE DRY CLEANER JUST WENT 

6945
04:36:24,867 --> 04:36:28,237
OUT OF BUSINESS.

6946
04:36:26,336 --> 04:36:30,073
NOBODY'S BRINGING IN SUITS TO 

6947
04:36:28,304 --> 04:36:34,043
GET DRY CLEANED AND NOBODY'S 

6948
04:36:30,139 --> 04:36:36,045
BRINGING IN WHITE SHIRTS TO 

6949
04:36:34,110 --> 04:36:39,515
GET -- THE SMALL BUSINESS 

6950
04:36:36,112 --> 04:36:40,950
PERSON, IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE 

6951
04:36:39,582 --> 04:36:43,086
TAKEOUT AND DELIVERY SERVICES 

6952
04:36:41,017 --> 04:36:45,088
FOR RESTAURANTS, YOU GOT KILLED.

6953
04:36:43,152 --> 04:36:47,757
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU'VE GOT

6954
04:36:45,155 --> 04:36:50,727
TAKEOUT FACILITIES THEN, YOU 

6955
04:36:47,824 --> 04:36:52,862
KNOW, SALES ARE UP A WHOLE LOT.

6956
04:36:50,794 --> 04:36:56,132
THEY ADAPTED.

6957
04:36:52,929 --> 04:36:57,633
BUT IT'S -- IT IS NOT A PRICE 

6958
04:36:56,199 --> 04:37:00,636
SENSITIVE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW AT 

6959
04:36:57,700 --> 04:37:03,439
IN LEAST, AND I DON'T KNOW 

6960
04:37:00,703 --> 04:37:05,241
EXACTLY HOW ONE SHOWS UP IN 

6961
04:37:03,506 --> 04:37:07,143
DIFFERENT PRICE INDICES.

6962
04:37:05,308 --> 04:37:09,812
BUT THERE'S MORE INFLATION GOING

6963
04:37:07,210 --> 04:37:12,181
ON, QUITE A BIT MORE INFLATION 

6964
04:37:09,879 --> 04:37:14,717
GOING ON THAN PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 

6965
04:37:12,248 --> 04:37:15,051
ANTICIPATED SIX MONTHS AGO OR 

6966
04:37:14,784 --> 04:37:16,518
THEREABOUTS. 

6967
04:37:15,117 --> 04:37:17,553
>> THERE'S ONE VERY INTELLIGENT 

6968
04:37:16,585 --> 04:37:22,992
MAN WHO THINKS IT'S DANGEROUS, 

6969
04:37:17,620 --> 04:37:25,094
AND THAT'S JUST THE START.

6970
04:37:23,059 --> 04:37:25,695
>> GREG, YOU PROBABLY ARE IN A 

6971
04:37:25,161 --> 04:37:27,063
GOOD POSITION. 

6972
04:37:25,761 --> 04:37:30,232
>> I THINK YOU TOUCH ON IT.

6973
04:37:27,130 --> 04:37:35,438
WHEN WE LOOK AT STEEL PRICES, 

6974
04:37:30,299 --> 04:37:37,841
TIMBER PRICES, PETROLEUM OUTPUT,

6975
04:37:35,505 --> 04:37:39,242
FUNDAMENTALLY THERE'S PRESSURE 

6976
04:37:37,907 --> 04:37:41,210
ON THE RAW MATERIALS.

6977
04:37:39,309 --> 04:37:43,612
I THINK YOU TOUCH ON SOMETHING, 

6978
04:37:41,277 --> 04:37:46,749
WARREN, THERE'S A SCARCITY OF 

6979
04:37:43,679 --> 04:37:47,016
PRODUCT OF CERTAIN RAW 

6980
04:37:46,816 --> 04:37:48,651
MATERIALS.

6981
04:37:47,083 --> 04:37:51,187
IT'S IMPACTING PRICE AND ABILITY

6982
04:37:48,718 --> 04:37:52,889
TO DELIVER THE END PRODUCT, BUT 

6983
04:37:51,254 --> 04:37:54,824
THAT SCARCITY FACTOR IS REAL OUT

6984
04:37:52,956 --> 04:37:55,892
THERE AS OUR BUSINESSES ADDRESS 

6985
04:37:54,891 --> 04:37:59,695
THAT CHALLENGE.

6986
04:37:55,959 --> 04:38:03,299
AND IT MAY BE SOME OF THAT HAS 

6987
04:37:59,762 --> 04:38:05,802
ARISEN FROM THE STORM WE 

6988
04:38:03,366 --> 04:38:08,504
PREVIOUSLY DISCUSS IN THE TEXAS.

6989
04:38:05,869 --> 04:38:10,840
WHEN YOU TAKE DOWN.

6990
04:38:08,571 --> 04:38:12,775
THAT PLANTS, WE'RE SEEING IT IN 

6991
04:38:10,907 --> 04:38:14,243
PRICE BUT OVERALL SCARCITY OF 

6992
04:38:12,842 --> 04:38:14,577
PRODUCT, WHICH OBVIOUSLY GO 

6993
04:38:14,310 --> 04:38:16,812
TOGETHER.

6994
04:38:14,644 --> 04:38:17,714
BUT THERE'S CHALLENGES, THAT'S 

6995
04:38:16,879 --> 04:38:25,722
FOR SURE.

6996
04:38:17,781 --> 04:38:25,955
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM B.J.

6997
04:38:25,789 --> 04:38:28,791
CORALA.

6998
04:38:26,022 --> 04:38:31,661
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF KWANS?

6999
04:38:28,858 --> 04:38:31,994
JIM SIMONS -- PROVES THAT IT 

7000
04:38:31,728 --> 04:38:35,331
WORKS.

7001
04:38:32,061 --> 04:38:37,333
WOULD YOU CONSIDER HIRING A 

7002
04:38:35,398 --> 04:38:37,500
LIEUTENANT TO WORK WITH TODD OR 

7003
04:38:37,400 --> 04:38:39,769
TED?

7004
04:38:37,566 --> 04:38:41,771
>> I'LL SAY NO TO THE FIRST PART

7005
04:38:39,836 --> 04:38:41,971
AND PROBABLY KNOW TO THE SECOND 

7006
04:38:41,837 --> 04:38:45,174
PART. 

7007
04:38:42,038 --> 04:38:49,379
>> THAT'S RATHER INTERESTING.

7008
04:38:45,241 --> 04:38:51,614
THE THING IT DID FABULOUSLY ON 

7009
04:38:49,445 --> 04:38:54,583
THE SHORT-TERM TRADING, THEY 

7010
04:38:51,681 --> 04:38:56,552
FOUND LITTLE ALGORITHMS THAT 

7011
04:38:54,650 --> 04:38:58,955
WORKED TO MAKE THEM -- HAD 

7012
04:38:56,619 --> 04:39:00,790
PREDICTIVE VALUE, AND AS LONG AS

7013
04:38:59,022 --> 04:39:02,792
THEY KEPT WORKING, THEY KEPT 

7014
04:39:00,857 --> 04:39:04,093
DOING IT AS LONG AS THE MONEY 

7015
04:39:02,859 --> 04:39:05,661
KEPT COMING IN.

7016
04:39:04,160 --> 04:39:08,063
THEY HAVE TO USE THE SAME SYSTEM

7017
04:39:05,728 --> 04:39:10,466
TO FIND SOME LITTLE ALGORITHM 

7018
04:39:08,130 --> 04:39:12,034
I'M GOING MECHANICALLY FOR 

7019
04:39:10,533 --> 04:39:14,170
LONG-TERM STOCK PREDICTIONS THE 

7020
04:39:12,101 --> 04:39:15,871
RECORD WAS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD.

7021
04:39:14,237 --> 04:39:18,374
AND IN THE SHORT-TERM STUFF, 

7022
04:39:15,938 --> 04:39:19,809
THEY FOUND IF THEY TRIED TO DO 

7023
04:39:18,441 --> 04:39:20,376
IT TOO MUCH THEY DESTROYED THEIR

7024
04:39:19,876 --> 04:39:22,077
OWN ADVANTAGE.

7025
04:39:20,442 --> 04:39:22,678
THERE WAS A LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT 

7026
04:39:22,144 --> 04:39:23,947
THEY COULD MAKE. 

7027
04:39:22,745 --> 04:39:24,180
>> BUT THEY WERE VERY, VERY 

7028
04:39:24,013 --> 04:39:26,716
SMART. 

7029
04:39:24,247 --> 04:39:27,816
>> YES, THEY GOT VERY RICH. 

7030
04:39:26,783 --> 04:39:30,853
>> VERY SMART. 

7031
04:39:27,883 --> 04:39:33,756
>> VERY SMART AND VERY RICH AND 

7032
04:39:30,920 --> 04:39:36,192
VERY HIGH GRADE, BY THE WAY. 

7033
04:39:33,822 --> 04:39:37,460
>> BUT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE 

7034
04:39:36,259 --> 04:39:39,495
MONEY TRADING STOCKS.

7035
04:39:37,526 --> 04:39:39,695
WE DON'T THINK WE KNOW HOW TO DO

7036
04:39:39,562 --> 04:39:41,497
IT.

7037
04:39:39,762 --> 04:39:43,365
IF WE KNEW HOW TO MAKE A LOT 

7038
04:39:41,564 --> 04:39:45,067
MORE MONEY TRADING STOCKS WE'D 

7039
04:39:43,432 --> 04:39:47,169
PROBABLY BE TRADING STOCKS, TOO,

7040
04:39:45,134 --> 04:39:48,871
BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT 

7041
04:39:47,236 --> 04:39:50,273
AND DON'T TRUST ANYBODY ELSE TO 

7042
04:39:48,938 --> 04:39:51,173
DO IT FOR US.

7043
04:39:50,340 --> 04:39:52,541
IT'S THAT SIMPLE. 

7044
04:39:51,240 --> 04:39:54,243
>> THIS QUESTION COMES FROM 

7045
04:39:52,608 --> 04:39:58,081
RICHARD WARNER.

7046
04:39:54,310 --> 04:39:58,881
MR. BUFFET ESPOUSED FOR DECADES 

7047
04:39:58,147 --> 04:40:00,950
THE PHILOSOPHY OF BUY AND HOLD 

7048
04:39:58,948 --> 04:40:03,152
OR HOLD FOREVER WAS TOO SHORT OF

7049
04:40:01,017 --> 04:40:06,722
A TIME PERIOD.

7050
04:40:03,219 --> 04:40:11,694
WAS IT A MISCONCEPTION ON MY 

7051
04:40:06,789 --> 04:40:16,365
PART OR HAVE THINGS CHANGED?

7052
04:40:11,761 --> 04:40:20,102
THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE EQUITY ON

7053
04:40:16,432 --> 04:40:22,605
THE PORTFOLIO LATELY. 

7054
04:40:20,169 --> 04:40:23,539
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S CHANGED. 

7055
04:40:22,671 --> 04:40:24,574
>> IT'S TOO MUCH.

7056
04:40:23,606 --> 04:40:25,541
IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT.

7057
04:40:24,640 --> 04:40:26,809
IT'S STILL TOO MUCH. 

7058
04:40:25,608 --> 04:40:28,844
>> I'D AGREE WITH THAT.

7059
04:40:26,876 --> 04:40:30,312
THE TRUTH IS, WE OWN -- OUR 

7060
04:40:28,911 --> 04:40:34,918
BUSINESSES ARE EQUITIES, SO WE 

7061
04:40:30,379 --> 04:40:36,886
OWN $400 BILLION OR 

7062
04:40:34,984 --> 04:40:37,253
$500 BILLION, MAYBE MORE IN 

7063
04:40:36,953 --> 04:40:38,988
BUSINESSES.

7064
04:40:37,320 --> 04:40:40,857
WE DON'T TURN THEM OVER AT ALL.

7065
04:40:39,055 --> 04:40:42,124
WE DON'T SELL BUSINESSES.

7066
04:40:40,924 --> 04:40:43,859
WE COULD PROBABLY -- WE WON'T 

7067
04:40:42,191 --> 04:40:47,329
EVEN GET INTO WHAT WE COULD DO, 

7068
04:40:43,926 --> 04:40:51,200
BUT WE DON'T DO IT.

7069
04:40:47,396 --> 04:40:53,269
AND WE DO RELATIVELY -- AS 

7070
04:40:51,267 --> 04:41:01,277
CHARLIE SAYS WE'D DO BETTER IF 

7071
04:40:53,336 --> 04:41:04,447
WE -- NOT WE -- IF I'D DUMP US.

WARREN BUFFET'S 2013 LETTER IN 

7074
04:41:06,949 --> 04:41:09,852
MIDDLE OF PAGE 21 MADE A 

7075
04:41:08,985 --> 04:41:12,021
PREDICTION THAT THE IN THE NEXT 

7076
04:41:09,919 --> 04:41:12,288
DECADE YOU'LL SEE BAD NEWS ABOUT

7077
04:41:12,088 --> 04:41:14,957
PENSIONS.

7078
04:41:12,355 --> 04:41:16,959
GIVEN RECENT EVENTS LIKE 

7079
04:41:15,024 --> 04:41:18,494
COVID-19 AND THAT 2023 IS TWO 

7080
04:41:17,026 --> 04:41:20,729
YEARS AWAY, WOULD MR. BUFFET 

7081
04:41:18,561 --> 04:41:22,565
LIKE TO COMMENT OR ARE A VISE 

7082
04:41:20,796 --> 04:41:26,402
HIS PREDICTION?

7083
04:41:22,632 --> 04:41:27,570
CAN COVID-19 ELIMINATE, DELAY, 

7084
04:41:26,469 --> 04:41:29,505
ACCELERATE OR NOT CHANGE IT?

7085
04:41:27,637 --> 04:41:34,744
>> WELL, IN A TERRIBLE WAY, 

7086
04:41:29,572 --> 04:41:36,779
COVID IMPROVES THE PENSION 

7087
04:41:34,811 --> 04:41:38,581
POSITION, BECAUSE IT'S -- YOU 

7088
04:41:36,846 --> 04:41:41,050
KNOW, YOU HAVE LESS PENSIONERS.

7089
04:41:38,648 --> 04:41:43,886
BUT THE PENSION SITUATION IS 

7090
04:41:41,117 --> 04:41:46,722
TERRIBLE IN A GREAT MANY STATES.

7091
04:41:43,953 --> 04:41:49,391
IT'S NOT IS BAD AT THE -- LEVEL.

04:41:46,789 --> 04:41:52,795
THERE ARE SOME MULTIEMPLOYER 

7093
04:41:49,458 --> 04:41:55,965
PLANS THAT HAVE GOT PROBLEMS, 

7094
04:41:52,862 --> 04:41:57,299
BUT BASICALLY IT'S A TERRIBE 

7095
04:41:56,032 --> 04:41:59,402
PROBLEM IN SOME STATES AND 

7096
04:41:57,366 --> 04:42:00,402
STATES ARE GOING TO GO TO 

7097
04:41:59,469 --> 04:42:02,438
WASHINGTON AND SAY, WE WANT TO 

7098
04:42:00,469 --> 04:42:03,572
GET A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE WE 

7099
04:42:02,505 --> 04:42:05,141
HAD THESE TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN

7100
04:42:03,639 --> 04:42:08,143
TO US DURING THE PANDEMIC, WHICH

7101
04:42:05,208 --> 04:42:09,979
THEY DID, BUT SOME OF THOSE 

7102
04:42:08,210 --> 04:42:10,713
STATES ARE ENORMOUS PENSION 

7103
04:42:10,046 --> 04:42:10,980
DEFICITS, AND THEY'LL COME 

7104
04:42:10,780 --> 04:42:13,416
AGAIN.

7105
04:42:11,047 --> 04:42:15,985
IF THEY GET A CHECK ONCE.

7106
04:42:13,483 --> 04:42:18,421
IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE A FEDERAL 

7107
04:42:16,052 --> 04:42:20,289
OBLIGATION, DE FACTO OR 

7108
04:42:18,488 --> 04:42:22,925
SOMETHING, THAT A STATE -- IT 

7109
04:42:20,356 --> 04:42:26,595
HAS NOT GOTTEN BETTER.

7110
04:42:22,992 --> 04:42:29,999
IT HAS NOT GOTTEN BETTER AT ALL,

7111
04:42:26,662 --> 04:42:31,667
OBVIOUSLY, AND TO A CERTAIN 

7112
04:42:30,066 --> 04:42:33,369
EXTENT, THE PENSION MANAGERS GET

7113
04:42:31,734 --> 04:42:35,270
MORE AND MORE DESPERATE AS 

7114
04:42:33,436 --> 04:42:37,239
INTEREST RATES GO DOWN, SO 

7115
04:42:35,337 --> 04:42:39,608
THEY'LL LISTEN TO ALMOST ANYBODY

7116
04:42:37,306 --> 04:42:41,577
THAT PROMISES THEM -- THEY'VE 

7117
04:42:39,675 --> 04:42:43,145
ALWAYS HAD THAT TENDENCY, BUT 

7118
04:42:41,644 --> 04:42:44,313
THEY'LL LISTEN TO PEOPLE THAT 

7119
04:42:43,212 --> 04:42:46,148
PROMISE THEM THEY'RE GOING TO 

7120
04:42:44,380 --> 04:42:47,183
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SOLVE THEIR 

7121
04:42:46,215 --> 04:42:49,085
PROBLEM FOR THEM, AND THAT ISN'T

7122
04:42:47,250 --> 04:42:51,653
GOING TO WORK.

7123
04:42:49,152 --> 04:42:54,356
SO IT'S A BIG, BIG, BIG PROBLEM,

7124
04:42:51,720 --> 04:42:57,626
AND OF COURSE THE REAL PROBLEM 

7125
04:42:54,423 --> 04:43:00,563
IS -- LET'S JUST TAKE A 

7126
04:42:57,693 --> 04:43:03,032
HYPOTHETICAL STATE THAT HAS A 

7127
04:43:00,629 --> 04:43:04,800
HUGE PENSION DEFICIT AND MAYBE 

7128
04:43:03,099 --> 04:43:06,301
EVEN HAVE A LOST OF LIVING 

7129
04:43:04,867 --> 04:43:07,469
FACTOR IN IT, WHICH IS REALLY 

7130
04:43:06,368 --> 04:43:08,904
GOING TO BE A KILLER.

7131
04:43:07,536 --> 04:43:09,605
AND YOU CAN MOVE IF YOU'RE AN 

7132
04:43:08,971 --> 04:43:11,407
INDIVIDUAL.

7133
04:43:09,672 --> 04:43:14,076
CHARLIE WON'T MOVE TO SAVE THAT.

7134
04:43:11,474 --> 04:43:15,043
HE'S NOT GOING TO MOVE TO NEVADA

7135
04:43:14,143 --> 04:43:16,745
OR SOME PLACE.

7136
04:43:15,110 --> 04:43:18,347
BUT YOU CAN MOVE IF YOU'RE AN 

7137
04:43:16,812 --> 04:43:19,348
INDIVIDUAL TO SOME DEGREE.

7138
04:43:18,414 --> 04:43:22,584
PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE RICH AND 

7139
04:43:19,415 --> 04:43:24,553
OLD AND RETIRED, AND YOU CAN 

7140
04:43:22,651 --> 04:43:26,021
ACTUALLY TAKE AWAY AN ASSET FROM

7141
04:43:24,620 --> 04:43:31,260
THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT AND 

7142
04:43:26,088 --> 04:43:32,628
GIVE IT TO ANOTHER TATESTATE TH 

7143
04:43:31,327 --> 04:43:33,829
DOESN'T NEED IT THAT MUCH.

7144
04:43:32,695 --> 04:43:35,698
YOU'LL GET ADVERSE SELECTION 

7145
04:43:33,896 --> 04:43:36,866
OVER TIME.

7146
04:43:35,765 --> 04:43:39,969
BUT IF YOU'RE A COMPANY AND PUT 

7147
04:43:36,933 --> 04:43:43,872
A PLANT THERE, YOU CAN'T MOVE 

7148
04:43:40,036 --> 04:43:45,774
THE PLANT IN 5, 10, 20 YEARS.

7149
04:43:43,939 --> 04:43:50,145
AS THE TAXABLE BASE OF 

7150
04:43:45,841 --> 04:43:50,946
INDIVIDUALS FALLS DOWN, SHRIMPL 

7151
04:43:50,212 --> 04:43:53,315
BECAUSE PEOPLE SELECT OUT OF 

7152
04:43:51,013 --> 04:43:55,418
BEING A PART OF THE POPULATION, 

7153
04:43:53,382 --> 04:43:56,552
YOU CAN'T SELECT OUT OF BEING A 

7154
04:43:55,485 --> 04:43:58,287
CORPORATION, SO YOU HAVE TO BE 

7155
04:43:56,619 --> 04:44:00,089
VERY CAREFUL AND THINK A LONG 

7156
04:43:58,354 --> 04:44:02,458
TIME BEFORE YOU GO AND A STATE 

7157
04:44:00,156 --> 04:44:03,359
WITH A HUGE PENSION DEFICIT AND 

7158
04:44:02,525 --> 04:44:04,493
DECLINING POPULATION BECAUSE 

7159
04:44:03,425 --> 04:44:06,528
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE LAST 

7160
04:44:04,560 --> 04:44:08,130
MAN LEFT AND THE PENSIONS WON'T 

7161
04:44:06,595 --> 04:44:09,398
GO AWAY.

7162
04:44:08,197 --> 04:44:11,700
AND I DON'T THINK -- WELL, 

7163
04:44:09,465 --> 04:44:12,902
ANYBODY WITH A SHORT-TERM 

7164
04:44:11,767 --> 04:44:13,102
OUTLOOK DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT 

7165
04:44:12,969 --> 04:44:14,970
THAT.

7166
04:44:13,169 --> 04:44:16,105
JUST GET ME PAST THE NEXT 

7167
04:44:15,037 --> 04:44:18,741
ELECTION AND I'M ALL RIGHT ON 

7168
04:44:16,172 --> 04:44:22,311
THAT ONE.

7169
04:44:18,808 --> 04:44:25,914
BUT THE -- WE DON'T WANT TO 

7170
04:44:22,377 --> 04:44:27,450
BE -- WE'RE NOT GOING TO -- 

7171
04:44:25,981 --> 04:44:29,952
PLANTS AROUND 50 YEARS IN SOME 

7172
04:44:27,517 --> 04:44:34,089
PLACE, WHERE THE POPULATION GETS

7173
04:44:30,019 --> 04:44:35,725
HALVED AND THE RICHER PART GETS 

7174
04:44:34,156 --> 04:44:37,693
CUT EVEN MORE DRAMATICALLY.

7175
04:44:35,792 --> 04:44:39,295
AND WE'VE STILL GOT A VALUABLE 

7176
04:44:37,760 --> 04:44:39,562
PLANT THERE AND GOT TO KEEP 

7177
04:44:39,362 --> 04:44:40,830
OPERATING.

7178
04:44:39,629 --> 04:44:50,106
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, IT'S NOT 

7179
04:44:40,897 --> 04:44:51,874
GOING TO BE A GOOD PLACE TO BE.

7180
04:44:50,173 --> 04:44:53,843
>> WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME SO 

7181
04:44:51,941 --> 04:44:57,946
I'LL MAKE THE LAST QUESTION. 

7182
04:44:53,909 --> 04:44:59,114
>> THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER.

7183
04:44:58,013 --> 04:45:01,216
MY OLD HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR 

7184
04:44:59,181 --> 04:45:04,019
USED TO SAY, LET ME KNOW WHAT 

7185
04:45:01,283 --> 04:45:04,553
YOUR PROBLEM IS AND I'LL MAKE IT

7186
04:45:04,086 --> 04:45:05,621
MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOU. 

7187
04:45:04,620 --> 04:45:05,888
>> THIS IS FOR WARREN AND 

7188
04:45:05,688 --> 04:45:07,890
CHARLIE.

7189
04:45:05,955 --> 04:45:09,791
I HAVE ONE QUESTION, WHICH IS 

7190
04:45:07,957 --> 04:45:12,895
INSPIRED BY CHARLIE'S MANTRA, 

7191
04:45:09,858 --> 04:45:13,929
YOU HAVE TO BE A CONTINUOUS 

7192
04:45:12,962 --> 04:45:14,263
LEARNING MACHINE.

7193
04:45:13,996 --> 04:45:16,298
H

7194
04:45:14,329 --> 04:45:17,466
HERE'S MY QUESTION -- WHAT'S THE

7195
04:45:16,365 --> 04:45:18,868
BIGGEST LESSON BOTH OF YOU 

7196
04:45:17,533 --> 04:45:20,369
LEARNED OVER THE LAST YEAR?

7197
04:45:18,935 --> 04:45:24,974
>> MY BIGGEST LESSON HAS BEEN TO

7198
04:45:20,435 --> 04:45:27,576
LISTEN MORE TO CHARLIE.

7199
04:45:25,041 --> 04:45:28,344
>> HE'S BEEN RIGHT ON SOME 

7200
04:45:27,643 --> 04:45:30,579
THINGS I HAVE BEEN WRONG ON. 

7201
04:45:28,410 --> 04:45:31,446
>> IF YOU'RE IN THE A LITTLE 

7202
04:45:30,646 --> 04:45:36,051
CONFUSED BY WHAT'S GOING ON, YOU

7203
04:45:31,513 --> 04:45:38,354
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

7204
04:45:36,118 --> 04:45:39,521
IT'S JUST -- WE'RE IN SORT OF 

7205
04:45:38,421 --> 04:45:42,591
UNCHARTED TERRITORY. 

7206
04:45:39,588 --> 04:45:43,626
>> WE ENJOY, IN A CRAZY WAY, 

7207
04:45:42,658 --> 04:45:49,865
ACTUALLY SEEING WHAT HAPPENS.

7208
04:45:43,693 --> 04:45:50,966
I MEAN, AND THIS HAS MADE US 

7209
04:45:49,932 --> 04:45:52,567
HALFWAY THROUGH THE MOVIE MUST 

7210
04:45:51,033 --> 04:46:08,350
HAVE MORE INTERESTED.

7211
04:45:52,634 --> 04:46:12,788
THIS IS AN UNUSUAL MOVIE.

7212
04:46:08,417 --> 04:46:15,490
WE MAY DISAPPOINT PEOPLE, BUT WE

7213
04:46:12,855 --> 04:46:17,226
DON'T -- AND WE'VE SEEN SOME 

7214
04:46:15,557 --> 04:46:21,263
STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN IN THE 

7215
04:46:17,293 --> 04:46:22,531
WORLD IN THE LAST YEAR, 15 

7216
04:46:21,330 --> 04:46:23,799
MONTHS, AND WE'VE ALWAYS 

7217
04:46:22,598 --> 04:46:27,803
RECOGNIZED THAT FACT THAT 

7218
04:46:23,866 --> 04:46:28,037
STRANGER THINGS ARE GOING THE 

7219
04:46:27,870 --> 04:46:30,606
HAPPEN.

7220
04:46:28,103 --> 04:46:33,442
I WOULD SAY IF ANYTHING IT'S 

7221
04:46:30,673 --> 04:46:34,676
REINFORCED OUR DESIRE TO FIGURE 

7222
04:46:33,509 --> 04:46:38,213
OUT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE WE CAN 

7223
04:46:34,743 --> 04:46:40,315
DO THE MAKE SURE THAT BERKSHIRE 

7224
04:46:38,280 --> 04:46:41,483
IS 50 OR 100 YEARS FROM NOW, 

7225
04:46:40,382 --> 04:46:42,117
EVERY BIT THE ORGANIZATION AND 

7226
04:46:41,550 --> 04:46:59,001
THEN SOME THAT IT IS NOW.

7227
04:46:42,184 --> 04:46:59,001
CHARLIE?

7228
04:46:59,201 --> 04:47:02,438
>> OF COURSE THAT'S THE IDEA.

7229
04:47:01,137 --> 04:47:05,474
IT'S PRETTY LIKELY TO WORK. 

7230
04:47:02,505 --> 04:47:05,741
>> BECKY, IS THAT THE LAST 

7231
04:47:05,541 --> 04:47:06,808
QUESTION?

7232
04:47:05,808 --> 04:47:08,844
>> OKAY, WELL, IN THIS CASE 

7233
04:47:06,875 --> 04:47:10,946
WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE MEETING.

7234
04:47:08,911 --> 04:47:11,580
THE OTHER THREE FELLOWS HERE CAN

7235
04:47:11,013 --> 04:47:13,215
LEAVE.

7236
04:47:11,647 --> 04:47:13,482
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT 

7237
04:47:13,282 --> 04:47:16,685
EXCITING.

7238
04:47:13,549 --> 04:47:16,952
BUT WE'VE GOT A SCRIPT HERE EVEN

7239
04:47:16,752 --> 04:47:21,456
SOMEWHAT.

7240
04:47:17,019 --> 04:47:22,691
I DON'T LIKE SCRIPTS BUT -- NOT 

7241
04:47:21,523 --> 04:47:30,098
MY NATURE.

7242
04:47:22,758 --> 04:47:32,167
AND ONE OF THE PROPOSERS OF THE 

7243
04:47:30,165 --> 04:47:43,679

WE'LL GET TO THAT IN JUST A

THE COMPANY'S AWE AUDITOR SAYS 

7454
04:55:39,721 --> 04:55:43,625
ON ITS WEBSITE, CLIMATE CHANGE 

7455
04:55:41,656 --> 04:55:44,326
IS NOT A CHOICE, IT'S BILLIONS 

7456
04:55:43,691 --> 04:55:47,663
OF THEM.

7457
04:55:44,393 --> 04:55:49,731
WE ARE ALL COMPELLED TO ACT.

7458
04:55:47,729 --> 04:55:51,933
DELOITTE DOES NOT ASSESS CLIMATE

7460
04:55:52,000 --> 04:55:56,538
IN THE COMPANY'S AUDIT.

7461
04:55:53,602 --> 04:55:59,474
WHEN ASKED BY THE COSPONSORS WHY

7462
04:55:56,605 --> 04:56:02,244
CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ARE 

7463
04:55:59,541 --> 04:56:03,645
EXCLUDED FROM AUDITS LIKE 

7464
04:56:02,311 --> 04:56:05,781
BERKSHIRES, DELOITTE FAILED TO

WE ASKED THE BOARD TO TAKE THE 

7482
04:56:38,880 --> 04:56:43,785
CULTURAL RISK FOR A MODEST 

7483
04:56:40,615 --> 04:56:45,753

TO RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION.

7542
04:59:10,799 --> 04:59:14,135
WHAT WOULD I MEAN IF THE 

7543
04:59:12,267 --> 04:59:15,837
MAJORITY OF BERKSHIRE'S 

7544
04:59:14,202 --> 04:59:17,539
OPERATING UNITS WEREN'T MANAGING

7545
04:59:15,904 --> 04:59:19,040
THEIR DIVERSITY PROGRAMS?

7546
04:59:17,606 --> 04:59:20,775
IT WOULD MEAN THAT BERKSHIRE 

7547
04:59:19,107 --> 04:59:23,544
KPRAENS MISSING OUT ON THE 

7548
04:59:20,842 --> 04:59:24,912
BENEFITS THAT AN INCLUSIVE 

7549
04:59:23,611 --> 04:59:28,016
WORKPLACE CULTURE CAN PROVIDE, 

7550
04:59:24,979 --> 04:59:30,852
SUCH AS ACCORDING TO STUDIES, 

7551
04:59:28,083 --> 04:59:32,454
ACCESS TO TOP TALENT, BETTER 

7552
04:59:30,919 --> 04:59:33,588
UNDERSTANDING OF CONSUMER 

7553
04:59:32,521 --> 04:59:35,523
PREFERENCES, STRONGER MIX OF 

7554
04:59:33,655 --> 04:59:40,495
LEADERSHIP SKILLS, INFORMED 

7555
04:59:35,590 --> 04:59:40,862
SKUGS AND IMPROVED RISK 

7556
04:59:40,562 --> 04:59:45,099
MANAGEMENT.

7557
04:59:40,929 --> 04:59:45,567
BEST PRACTICES IN REPORTING 

7558
04:59:45,166 --> 04:59:47,869
EXIST.

7559
04:59:45,634 --> 04:59:50,805
BERKSHIRE COMPANIES CAN PUBLISH 

7560
04:59:47,936 --> 04:59:51,005
THEIR COMPOSITION THROUGH THEIR 

7561
04:59:50,872 --> 04:59:54,709
FORM.

7562
04:59:51,072 --> 04:59:55,343
THIS IS ALREADY SUBMITTED TO THE

7563
04:59:54,776 --> 04:59:56,811
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY 

7564
04:59:55,410 --> 04:59:58,813
COMMISSION SO IT REQUIRES NO -- 

7565
04:59:56,878 --> 05:00:00,915
IT IS A UNIVERSALLY DISLIKED 

7566
04:59:58,880 --> 05:00:02,583
FORM, BUT IT IS STANDARDIZED AND

7567
05:00:00,982 --> 05:00:04,452
COMPANIES WILL OFTEN PUB LESH 

7568
05:00:02,650 --> 05:00:06,154
THEIR E 01 ALONG WITH A 

7569
05:00:04,519 --> 05:00:08,456
DISCUSSION OF THEIR OWN INTERNAL

7570
05:00:06,221 --> 05:00:14,829
STRUCTURES AND WAYS.

7571
05:00:08,523 --> 05:00:17,165
72 OF THE 100 S&P 500 COMPANIES 

7572
05:00:14,896 --> 05:00:18,433
PUBLICLY SHARE THIS FORM AT TO 

7573
05:00:17,232 --> 05:00:20,668
MY KNOWLEDGE NO BERKSHIRE 

7574
05:00:18,500 --> 05:00:23,671
HATHAWAY COMPANY DOES, NOT ONE.

7575
05:00:20,735 --> 05:00:25,206
IT'S AKIN TO A BALANCE SHEET 

7576
05:00:23,738 --> 05:00:25,640
DETAILING DIVERSITY AT A SINGLE 

7577
05:00:25,273 --> 05:00:28,043
POINT IN TIME.

7578
05:00:25,707 --> 05:00:29,710
JUST AS A BALANCE SHEET WOULD BY

7579
05:00:28,110 --> 05:00:31,746
ITSELF BE INSUFFICIENT TO 

7580
05:00:29,777 --> 05:00:33,148
IDENTIFY THE STRENGTH OF A 

7581
05:00:31,813 --> 05:00:36,284
COMPANY'S FINANCIALS.

7582
05:00:33,215 --> 05:00:38,753
SO TOO THE E 01 BY ITSELF IS 

7583
05:00:36,351 --> 05:00:41,923
INSUFFICIENT IF ASSESSING THE 

7584
05:00:38,820 --> 05:00:48,596
EFFECTIVENESS OF DEI PROGRAMS 

7585
05:00:41,989 --> 05:00:49,197
THE COMPANY'S DATA, HIRING 

7586
05:00:48,663 --> 05:00:49,831
RETE

7587
05:00:49,264 --> 05:00:50,298
RETENTION, AND PROMOTION RATES 

7588
05:00:49,898 --> 05:00:51,999
MUST ALSO BE SHARED.

7589
05:00:50,365 --> 05:00:53,000
INVESTORS NEED TO HAVE A FULL 

7590
05:00:52,066 --> 05:00:55,503
UNDERSTANDING OF THE ACTUAL 

7591
05:00:53,067 --> 05:00:55,770
EXPERIENCE OF BERKSHIRE 

7592
05:00:55,570 --> 05:00:57,338
EMPLOYEES.

7593
05:00:55,837 --> 05:00:59,441
IN THEORY, COMPANIES SHOULD WANT

7594
05:00:57,405 --> 05:01:01,242
TO SHARE THEIR RETENTION DATA.

7595
05:00:59,508 --> 05:01:03,611
IF IT'S A GOOD COMPANY TO WORK 

7596
05:01:01,309 --> 05:01:05,513
FOR, PEOPLE WILL WANT TO STAY.

7597
05:01:03,678 --> 05:01:06,915
THEY SHOULD WANT TO SHARE THEIR 

7598
05:01:05,580 --> 05:01:09,317
PROMOTION DATA IN THEORY.

7599
05:01:06,982 --> 05:01:10,752
IF IT'S A COMPANY THAT HIRES 

7600
05:01:09,383 --> 05:01:14,088
GOOD PEOPLE AND TREATS THEM 

7601
05:01:10,819 --> 05:01:16,658
WELL, THOSE GOOD PEOPLE WILL 

7602
05:01:14,155 --> 05:01:18,759
ASCEND WITH MENTORSHIP AND TIME.

7603
05:01:16,725 --> 05:01:20,595
70% OF THE S&P 500 SHARE 

7604
05:01:18,826 --> 05:01:20,828
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AT SOME 

7605
05:01:20,662 --> 05:01:22,897
LEVEL.

7606
05:01:20,895 --> 05:01:26,668
ONLY 22% OF THE BERKSHIRE 

7607
05:01:22,964 --> 05:01:28,870
COMPANIES DO AT ANY LEVEL.

7608
05:01:26,735 --> 05:01:31,873
AND ONLY FOUR WORK WITH EQUITY 

7609
05:01:28,936 --> 05:01:33,908
AT ANY MEANINGFUL DEPTH.

7610
05:01:31,940 --> 05:01:34,609
BERKSHIRE IS A SERIOUS OUTLIER 

7611
05:01:33,975 --> 05:01:38,113
HERE.

7612
05:01:34,676 --> 05:01:38,447
BERKSHIRE IS FAMOUSLY 

7613
05:01:38,180 --> 05:01:42,884
DECENTRALIZED.

7614
05:01:38,513 --> 05:01:46,020
ITS UNITS OPERATE REMOTELY.

7615
05:01:42,951 --> 05:01:48,089
BUT IF AN ISSUE ISN'T IMPORTANT 

7616
05:01:46,087 --> 05:01:50,725
FROM HEADQUARTERS, CAN WE EXPECT

7617
05:01:48,156 --> 05:01:51,793
IT TO BE PRIORITIZED BY AN 

7618
05:01:50,792 --> 05:01:52,961
OPERATING UNIT?

7619
05:01:51,860 --> 05:01:55,096
HERE'S THE THING.

7620
05:01:53,028 --> 05:01:57,866
MR. BUFFET, MR. MUNGER, BOARD 

7621
05:01:55,163 --> 05:01:59,667

7622
05:01:57,933 --> 05:02:01,569

WINLY HIRE, MENTOR, AND PROMOTE 

7625
05:02:04,138 --> 05:02:08,009
THE BEST PEOPLE FOR THE JOB, 

7626
05:02:06,140 --> 05:02:12,247
REGARDLESS OF THEIR GENDER, 

7627
05:02:08,076 --> 05:02:14,883

7628
05:02:12,314 --> 05:02:16,450
ORIENTATION OR ANY INMUTABLE 

7629
05:02:14,950 --> 05:02:18,353
CHARACTERISTIC, BUT WE CAN'T 

7630

05:02:18,420 --> 05:02:21,656
EACH OF YOUR EMPLOYEES, MANAGERS

7632

AND HIRING DIRECTORS.

7633
05:02:21,723 --> 05:02:26,427
BERKSHIRE HEADQUARTERS CAN'T SIT

7634
05:02:23,658 --> 05:02:27,662
PASSIVE WILL AND I HOPE THEIR 

7635
05:02:26,494 --> 05:02:29,564
INDEPENDENT UNITS ARE ADDRESSING

7636
05:02:27,729 --> 05:02:30,031
BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE 

7637
05:02:29,631 --> 05:02:31,699
WORKPLACE.

7638
05:02:30,098 --> 05:02:32,934
ACTIVE MANAGEMENT, PROACTIVE 

7639
05:02:31,766 --> 05:02:34,369
ATTENTION IS NEEDED.

7640
05:02:33,001 --> 05:02:37,238

7646
05:02:45,446 --> 05:02:51,452
IT ALSO STATES MR. BUFFET HAS A

7660
05:03:24,552 --> 05:03:29,758
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS,

7661
05:03:28,123 --> 05:03:33,695
BUT SILENCE HERE SPEAKS VOLUMES.

7662
05:03:29,824 --> 05:03:34,329

7726
05:05:55,804 --> 05:05:59,540
ROOM, YOU GUYS, DIFFERENT FROM 

7727
05:05:57,805 --> 05:06:01,776
LAST YEAR WHEN THERE WAS 

7728
05:05:59,607 --> 05:06:06,147
ABSOLUTELY NO ONE IN THE 

7729
05:06:01,843 --> 05:06:07,448
CAVERNOUS CHI CENTER IN OMAHA.

7730
05:06:06,214 --> 05:06:08,383
THERE ARE DIRECTORS.

7731
05:06:07,515 --> 05:06:09,317
YOU CAN HEAR THEM TALKING BEHIND

7732
05:06:08,450 --> 05:06:11,486
ME NOW.

7733
05:06:09,384 --> 05:06:12,486
A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM TURNED 

7734
05:06:11,553 --> 05:06:15,556
OUT, SO THERE WAS SOME REACTION 

7735
05:06:12,553 --> 05:06:16,691
AND RESPONSE TO THE ZINGERS IN 

7736
05:06:15,623 --> 05:06:17,892

7737
05:06:16,758 --> 05:06:19,994
MUNGER DELIVERED TO THE CROWD, 

7738
05:06:17,959 --> 05:06:22,096
BUT STILL, NOT THE SAME AS THE 

7739
05:06:20,060 --> 05:06:22,296
40,000 PEOPLE WHO ATTEND EACH 

7740
05:06:22,163 --> 05:06:23,898
YEAR.

7741
05:06:22,363 --> 05:06:26,467
YOU HEARD BUFFET AT THE END TALK

7742
05:06:23,965 --> 05:06:28,636

7744
05:06:28,703 --> 05:06:35,910
COURSE HE HAD THE EXACT DATE 

7745
05:06:31,305 --> 05:06:37,945
RIGHT THERE, APRIL 30th OF 2022.

7746
05:06:35,977 --> 05:06:39,013
I WANT TO GO AROUND AND GET 

7747
05:06:38,012 --> 05:06:39,714
REACTION TOP LINE FROM THE 

7748
05:06:39,080 --> 05:06:41,282
PANEL.

7749
05:06:39,781 --> 05:06:41,449
MILES, WHY DON'T WE START WITH 

7750
05:06:41,349 --> 05:06:43,751
YOU?

7751
05:06:41,515 --> 05:06:45,486
>> ANDY, IT'S FUNNY, EVERY YEAR 

7752
05:06:43,818 --> 05:06:46,988
YOU COME OUT AND YOU ALWAYS 

7753
05:06:45,552 --> 05:06:49,190
THINK ABOUT TONE AND TOPICS.

7754
05:06:47,054 --> 05:06:50,724
I WAS THINKING ABOUT LAST YEAR'S

7755
05:06:49,257 --> 05:06:53,961
MEETING, AND WROTE ABOUT IT A 

7756
05:06:50,791 --> 05:06:54,194
LITTLE THIS MORNING ON YAHOO 

7757
05:06:54,028 --> 05:06:55,797
FINANCE.

7758
05:06:54,261 --> 05:06:56,063
THAT WAS KIND OF THE BOTTOM OF 

7759
05:06:55,864 --> 05:06:58,466
SORTS.

7760
05:06:56,130 --> 05:07:00,501
IF YOU GO THROUGH AND LOOK AT A 

7761
05:06:58,533 --> 05:07:00,902
BUNCH OF NATIONAL COVID 

7762
05:07:00,568 --> 05:07:02,369
STATISTICS.

7763
05:07:00,969 --> 05:07:04,372
IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE THE 

7764
05:07:02,436 --> 05:07:04,539
ECONOMY WAS, WHERE EVERYONE'S TU

7765
05:07:04,439 --> 05:07:07,107
WAS.

7766
05:07:04,605 --> 05:07:08,042
THE MARK OF COURSE WE NOW KNOW 

7767
05:07:07,174 --> 05:07:10,144
BOTTOMED ABOUT SIX WEEKS BEFORE 

7768
05:07:08,109 --> 05:07:11,412
THAT MEETING, WHICH I BELIEVE 

7769
05:07:10,211 --> 05:07:12,680
THE EXACT DATE WOULD HAVE BEEN 

7770
05:07:11,479 --> 05:07:15,883
MAY 2nd.

7771
05:07:12,747 --> 05:07:20,187
BUT IT WAS REALLY KIND OF THE 

7772
05:07:15,950 --> 05:07:21,689
ABSOLUTE TROUGH, THE COVID 

7773
05:07:20,254 --> 05:07:22,656
MOMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.

7774
05:07:21,756 --> 05:07:24,358
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DARK DAYS 

7775
05:07:22,723 --> 05:07:27,761
SINCE THEN, BUT NOW WE'RE 

7776
05:07:24,425 --> 05:07:29,530
TALKING ABOUT MORE THAN 50% OF 

7777
05:07:27,828 --> 05:07:30,531
THE POPULATION WITH TAT LEAST OE

7778
05:07:29,597 --> 05:07:31,933
SHOT OF THE VACCINE.

7779
05:07:30,598 --> 05:07:33,767
WE'RE SEEING THINGS RE-OPEN.

7780
05:07:32,000 --> 05:07:37,004
TO THAT END, THE CONVERSATION 

7781
05:07:33,834 --> 05:07:37,938
THIS YEAR WAS MUCH MORE A 

7782
05:07:37,071 --> 05:07:38,339
CLASSIC BUFFET CONVERSATION, IF 

7783
05:07:38,005 --> 05:07:40,641
YOU WILL.

7784
05:07:38,406 --> 05:07:43,377
I KNOW WE'LL GET TO KIND OF THE 

7785
05:07:40,708 --> 05:07:45,213
HISTORY LESSON WE HAD AT THE 

7786
05:07:43,444 --> 05:07:46,881
BEGINNING WITH THE TOP 20 STOCKS

7787
05:07:45,280 --> 05:07:48,649
NOW VERSUS 30 YEARS AGO.

7788
05:07:46,948 --> 05:07:51,152
BUFFET KIND OF TALKED ABOUT THE 

7789
05:07:48,716 --> 05:08:00,394
ECONOMY, NEWS OF THE DAY.

7790
05:07:51,219 --> 05:08:01,428
BUT WE HAD A LITTLE -- IT SEEM 

7791
05:08:00,461 --> 05:08:03,297
LAST YEAR HE WAS TRYING TO PEP 

7792
05:08:01,495 --> 05:08:05,766
UP THE COUNTRY, PEP UP HIMSELF 

7793
05:08:03,364 --> 05:08:08,903
AND NOT GOB SO DOUR.

7794
05:08:05,833 --> 05:08:11,472
BUT JULIA, IT DID FEEL LIKE YOU 

7795
05:08:08,970 --> 05:08:12,973
CAN SORT OF THE GET BUFFET 

7796
05:08:11,539 --> 05:08:14,408
TRYING TO, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE 

7797
05:08:13,040 --> 05:08:16,143
SOUND MORE NORMAL.

7798
05:08:14,475 --> 05:08:18,379
AT A CERTAIN POINT THE YEARS ALL

7799
05:08:16,210 --> 05:08:20,481
RUN TOGETHER, BUT THIS ONE MAYBE

7800
05:08:18,446 --> 05:08:20,881
DIDN'T FEEL SO SAD AS LAST 

7801
05:08:20,548 --> 05:08:23,150
YEAR'S FELT. 

7802
05:08:20,948 --> 05:08:24,051
>> MILES, I THINK YOU TOTALLY 

7803
05:08:23,217 --> 05:08:25,987
NAILED IT.

7804
05:08:24,118 --> 05:08:34,695
I ACTUALLY REWATCHED LAST YEAR'S

7805
05:08:26,054 --> 05:08:36,931
MEETING, AT LEAST THE S-- EVEN 

7806
05:08:34,762 --> 05:08:37,698
THOUGH HE HAD A BULLISH 

7807
05:08:36,998 --> 05:08:40,100
UNDERTONE, I THINK LAST YEAR A 

7808
05:08:37,765 --> 05:08:41,269
LOT OF FOLKS WERE LOOKING TO 

7809
05:08:40,167 --> 05:08:43,871
WARREN BUFFET BECAUSE IT WAS 

7810
05:08:41,335 --> 05:08:46,307
SUCH UNCHARTED TERRITORY.

7811
05:08:43,938 --> 05:08:47,374
REMEMBER HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE HIS

7812
05:08:46,374 --> 05:08:47,909
HAIRCUT LAST YEAR LIKE THE REST 

7813
05:08:47,441 --> 05:08:50,912
OF US.

7814
05:08:47,976 --> 05:08:52,680
BUT YEAH, I WOULD ALSO AGREE 

7815
05:08:50,979 --> 05:08:54,849
WITH YOU.

7816
05:08:52,747 --> 05:08:57,018
A LOT OF THINGS CHANGED.

7817
05:08:54,916 --> 05:08:57,285
HE REFERENCED THAT IN THE 

7818
05:08:57,085 --> 05:08:59,554
BEGINNING.

7819
05:08:57,352 --> 05:09:01,455
WE WILL GET TO THAT AS YOU JUST 

7820
05:08:59,621 --> 05:09:02,055
MENTIONED.

7821
05:09:01,522 --> 05:09:04,826
BUT EVEN IT'S YEAR, TALKING 

7822
05:09:02,122 --> 05:09:05,093
ABOUT THE RISE OF THE RETAIL 

7823
05:09:04,892 --> 05:09:09,129
INVESTOR.

7824
05:09:05,159 --> 05:09:09,696
EVEN BRINGING UP ROBIN HOOD, 

7825
05:09:09,196 --> 05:09:11,198
GAMBLING WITHIN -- KIND OF 

7826
05:09:09,763 --> 05:09:12,833
TALKING ABOUT THE CASINO AND 

7827
05:09:11,265 --> 05:09:13,901
WARNING ABOUT THAT.

7828
05:09:12,900 --> 05:09:17,204
WHILE AMERICAN COMPANIES ARE A 

7829
05:09:13,968 --> 05:09:18,305
GREAT PLACE TO PUT YOUR MONEY 

7830
05:09:17,271 --> 05:09:20,341
AND INVEST AND SAVE YOU HAVE TO 

7831
05:09:18,372 --> 05:09:22,977
BE VERY CAREFUL, TOO.

7832
05:09:20,408 --> 05:09:25,046
THOSE WERE MY KEY TAKEAWAYS 

7833
05:09:23,044 --> 05:09:27,615
HERE.

7834
05:09:25,113 --> 05:09:28,182
SHOULD WE BRING IN -- AKIKO, 

7835
05:09:27,682 --> 05:09:30,150
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

7836
05:09:28,249 --> 05:09:31,352
>> I SHOULD POINT OUT, THIS IS 

7837
05:09:30,217 --> 05:09:31,619
MY FIRST YEAR COVERING THE 

7838
05:09:31,418 --> 05:09:33,054
EVENT.

7839
05:09:31,686 --> 05:09:34,388
IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE JUST HOW

7840
05:09:33,121 --> 05:09:37,124
BROAD THE QUESTIONS WERE.

7841
05:09:34,455 --> 05:09:40,561
PICKING UP ON YOUR POINT, 

7842
05:09:37,191 --> 05:09:41,696
THOUGH, ABOUT WHAT WARREN BUFFET

7843
05:09:40,628 --> 05:09:43,831
SAYS ABOUT THE ROBIN HOOD TRADE,

7844
05:09:41,763 --> 05:09:45,900
WHAT STOOD OUT TO ME IN THESE 

7845
05:09:43,898 --> 05:09:47,602
HOURS THAT HE ANSWERED PATIENTLY

7846
05:09:45,967 --> 05:09:49,637
ALL THE QUESTIONS WAS A BIT OF A

7847
05:09:47,669 --> 05:09:50,838
DIVIDE I SAW BETWEEN THE 

7848
05:09:49,704 --> 05:09:52,806
SENTIMENT OF THE MARKET IS RIGHT

7849
05:09:50,905 --> 05:09:54,708
NOW, WHERE SOME OF THE 

7850
05:09:52,873 --> 05:09:56,510
EXCITEMENT IS VERSUS WHERE BOTH 

7851
05:09:54,775 --> 05:09:57,378
WARREN BUFFET AND CHARLIE MUNGER

7852
05:09:56,577 --> 05:10:00,147
SEE THE OPPORTUNITIES.

7853
05:09:57,445 --> 05:10:03,150
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BITCOIN FOR 

7854
05:10:00,214 --> 05:10:04,185
EXAMPLE, NO SURPRISE, STRONG 

7855
05:10:03,217 --> 05:10:06,320
OPINION THERE FROM CHARLIE 

7856
05:10:04,252 --> 05:10:09,724
MUNGER SAYING OF COURSE HE HATES

7857
05:10:06,387 --> 05:10:12,259
THE BITCOIN SUCCESS, AND HE 

7858
05:10:09,790 --> 05:10:13,394
THINKS THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT IS 

7859
05:10:12,326 --> 05:10:14,829
DISGUSTING AND CONTRARY TO THE 

7860
05:10:13,461 --> 05:10:17,164
INTEREST OF CIVILIZATION.

7861
05:10:14,896 --> 05:10:19,333
THOSE WERE HIS WORDS.

7862
05:10:17,231 --> 05:10:20,234
I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS 

7863
05:10:19,400 --> 05:10:21,602
INTERESTING THE COMMENT ON THE 

7864
05:10:20,301 --> 05:10:24,271
CLIMB ISSUE -- AT THE END OF 

7865
05:10:21,668 --> 05:10:27,241
MEET WING SAW THE PROPOSAL VOTED

7866
05:10:24,338 --> 05:10:29,276
DOWN FOR INCREASED DISCLOSURES 

7867
05:10:27,308 --> 05:10:31,846
ON CLIMATE RISK.

7868
05:10:29,343 --> 05:10:36,116
BUT WE HEARD FROM WARREN BUFFET 

7869
05:10:31,912 --> 05:10:37,952
WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS -- 

7870
05:10:36,183 --> 05:10:40,655
HOW HE FELT ABOUT THAT IN THE 

7871
05:10:38,018 --> 05:10:42,123
DISCUSSION OF BUILDING CLIMATE 

7872
05:10:40,722 --> 05:10:43,024
RISK, INVESTING IN A FOSS YOU 

7873
05:10:42,190 --> 05:10:45,092
WILL FUEL COMPANY.

7874
05:10:43,090 --> 05:10:47,828
HE REALLY SEEMED TO DOUBLE DOWN,

7875
05:10:45,159 --> 05:10:48,129
SAYING CHEVRON IS NOT AN EVIL 

7876
05:10:47,895 --> 05:10:50,264
COMPANY.

7877
05:10:48,196 --> 05:10:51,832
HE SAYS I HAVE NO COMPUNCTION 

7878
05:10:50,331 --> 05:10:54,235
ABOUT OWNING IT.

7879
05:10:51,899 --> 05:10:59,039
IN FACT WE WENT FURTHER AND 

7880
05:10:54,302 --> 05:11:00,341
SAID, IF WE OWNED THE ENTIRE 

7881
05:10:59,106 --> 05:11:00,675
BUSINESS I WOULDN'T FEEL 

7882
05:11:00,408 --> 05:11:04,178
UNCOMFORTABLE.

7883
05:11:00,741 --> 05:11:05,579
THAT SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF DIVIDE

7884
05:11:04,245 --> 05:11:06,780
WHERE INVESTMENT SENTIMENT IS.

7885
05:11:05,646 --> 05:11:07,581
WE'VE GOT THE S.E.C. WEIGHING IN

7886
05:11:06,847 --> 05:11:09,750
ON THAT.

7887
05:11:07,648 --> 05:11:11,686
SO NOT SO SURE IN THE END IF 

7888
05:11:09,817 --> 05:11:13,587
BERKSHIRE IS GOING TO HAVE THEIR

7889
05:11:11,753 --> 05:11:15,456
HAND FORCED ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE 

7890
05:11:13,654 --> 05:11:16,791
OF REGULATION, BUT I THOUGHT 

7891
05:11:15,522 --> 05:11:17,458
THAT WAS AN INTERESTING 

7892
05:11:16,858 --> 05:11:20,428
COMMENTARY, TOO. 

7893
05:11:17,525 --> 05:11:20,695
>> OKAY, THANKS, AKIKO AND 

7894
05:11:20,495 --> 05:11:23,164
MILES.

7895
05:11:20,762 --> 05:11:25,466
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

7896
05:11:23,231 --> 05:11:26,000
BREAK, BUT WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK 

7897
05:11:25,532 --> 05:11:27,601
AFTER THAT.

7898
05:11:26,067 --> 05:11:30,471
MUCH MORE TO DISCUSS HERE AT 

7899
05:11:27,668 --> 05:11:32,206

05:11:30,538 --> 05:11:32,740

SAY. 

7911
05:14:43,030 --> 05:14:52,172
>> THIS ECONOMY RIGHT NOW IS 85%

7912
05:14:47,434 --> 05:14:56,677
OF IT IS RUNNING IN SUPER HIGH 

7913
05:14:52,239 --> 05:14:58,512
GEAR, AND PEOPLE CAN'T -- AND 

7914
05:14:56,744 --> 05:15:01,348
YOU'RE SEEING SOME INFLATION.

05:14:58,579 --> 05:15:01,515
RESPOND IN THE AN INCREDIBLE 

7916
05:15:01,415 --> 05:15:02,082
WAY.

7917
05:15:01,581 --> 05:15:06,620
I DON'T THINK IT WAS A SURE 

7918
05:15:02,149 --> 05:15:09,423
THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

7919
05:15:06,687 --> 05:15:12,126
>> LET'S BRING IN EMPIRE 

7920
05:15:09,490 --> 05:15:12,393
FINANCIAL RESEARCH FOUNDER AND 

7921
05:15:12,193 --> 05:15:15,696
CEO.

7922
05:15:12,460 --> 05:15:16,363
LET ME FIRST GET YOUR THOUGHTS 

7923
05:15:15,763 --> 05:15:17,998
ON WHAT STOOD OUT TO YOU IN 

7924
05:15:16,430 --> 05:15:20,034
TERMS OF WHAT HE HEARD FROM 

7925
05:15:18,065 --> 05:15:20,267
WARREN BUFFET AND CHARLIE MUNGER

7926
05:15:20,101 --> 05:15:23,570
TODAY. 

7927
05:15:20,334 --> 05:15:25,105
>> THIS IS MY 23rd CONSECUTIVE 

7928
05:15:23,637 --> 05:15:27,574
BERKSHIRE MEETING.

7929
05:15:25,172 --> 05:15:30,811
THE THING THAT REALLY JUMPED UP 

7930
05:15:27,641 --> 05:15:33,614
OUT AT ME WAS THEY SPENT SOME 

7931
05:15:30,878 --> 05:15:37,017
TIME TALKING ABOUT THE FIST RISK

7932
05:15:33,681 --> 05:15:37,551
FACTOR OF ANYONE BUYING A STOCK 

7933
05:15:37,084 --> 05:15:39,720
SHOULD BE BAD MANAGEMENT.

7934
05:15:37,618 --> 05:15:40,854
THAT CAN MESS UP A BUSINESS.

7935
05:15:39,786 --> 05:15:42,422
THEN THEY LAMENTED THE 

7936
05:15:40,921 --> 05:15:43,223
DIFFICULTY OF GETTING RID OF A 

7937
05:15:42,489 --> 05:15:45,025
DIFFICULT CEO.

7938
05:15:43,290 --> 05:15:47,962
IT GOT BACK TO THE MAIN THING I 

7939
05:15:45,092 --> 05:15:49,196
FOCUS ON WHEN IT COMES TO 

7940
05:15:48,029 --> 05:15:50,864
BERKSHIRE, WHICH ISN'T BAD 

7941
05:15:49,263 --> 05:15:51,465
MANAGEMENT, BUT AGING 

7942
05:15:50,931 --> 05:15:53,266
MANAGEMENT.

7943
05:15:51,532 --> 05:15:55,035
AND WE HAVE SEEN IT OVER AND 

7944
05:15:53,333 --> 05:15:58,072
OVER AGAIN WHERE YOU GET SOME 

7945
05:15:55,102 --> 05:16:01,641
LEGENDARY CEO, HE STARTS TO LOSE

7946
05:15:58,139 --> 05:16:02,443
HIS MARBLES DUE TO OLD AGE LIKE 

7947
05:16:01,708 --> 05:16:04,878
WE ALL DO.

7948
05:16:02,510 --> 05:16:07,147
SO THE FIRST THING I LOOK FOR AT

7949
05:16:04,945 --> 05:16:09,083
ANY ANNUAL MEETING WHEN I SEE 

7950
05:16:07,214 --> 05:16:11,218
BUFFET OR MUNGER ON TELEVISION 

7951
05:16:09,150 --> 05:16:14,054
IS, ARE THEY LOSING IT?

7952
05:16:11,285 --> 05:16:17,290
WE JUST SAW A 90-YEAR-OLD MAN 

7953
05:16:14,121 --> 05:16:18,792
BACKED UP BY A 97-YEAR-OLD MAN 

7954
05:16:17,357 --> 05:16:21,228
GO FOR FOUR CONSECUTIVE HOURS 

7955
05:16:18,859 --> 05:16:23,030
WITHOUT EVEN A BATHROOM BREAK 

7956
05:16:21,295 --> 05:16:26,266
BEING ASKED DOZENS OF QUESTIONS 

7957
05:16:23,097 --> 05:16:26,800
THEY HAD NO ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE 

7958
05:16:26,333 --> 05:16:28,668
OF.

7959
05:16:26,867 --> 05:16:30,771
23 YEARS AGO AT MY FIRST ANNUAL 

7960
05:16:28,735 --> 05:16:31,038
MEETING THEY SOUNDED THE SAME 

7961
05:16:30,838 --> 05:16:33,073
TODAY.

7962
05:16:31,105 --> 05:16:36,110
IT'S REMARKABLE.

7963
05:16:33,140 --> 05:16:42,016
I JUST GOOGLED AVERAGE LIFE 

7964
05:16:36,177 --> 05:16:43,350
EXPECTANCY OF IS 77 YEARS OLD.

7965
05:16:42,083 --> 05:16:45,752
THEY'RE GIVING THE SAME ANSWERS 

7966
05:16:43,417 --> 05:16:47,254
BUT MIXING IT UP, AND THERE'S 

7967
05:16:45,819 --> 05:16:47,788
ALWAYS NEW STUFF THROWN IN 

7968
05:16:47,321 --> 05:16:50,257
THERE.

7969
05:16:47,855 --> 05:16:54,528
YOU HAVE TO SIT BACK AND BE IN 

7970
05:16:50,324 --> 05:16:57,531
AWE THESE GUYS ARE GOING STRONG 

7971
05:16:54,595 --> 05:16:58,932
AT THEIR RESPECTED AGES. 

7972
05:16:57,598 --> 05:17:00,333
>> WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE 

7973
05:16:58,999 --> 05:17:03,370
QUESTIONS THAT WENT ALONG THE 

7974
05:17:00,400 --> 05:17:04,504
LINES OF, YOU GUYS MISSED A HUGE

7975
05:17:03,437 --> 05:17:05,806
OPPORTUNITY LAST MARCH, YOU 

7976
05:17:04,571 --> 05:17:09,643
DIDN'T STEP UP TO THE PLATE, AND

7977
05:17:05,873 --> 05:17:12,179
YOU LET US DOWN AS SHAREHOLDERS?

7978
05:17:09,710 --> 05:17:13,814
>> IN FACT, SOLD THE AIRLINES.

7979
05:17:12,245 --> 05:17:15,348
SOLD THE BANKS.

7980
05:17:13,881 --> 05:17:17,284
THAT WAS A $10 BILLION MISTAKE.

7981
05:17:15,415 --> 05:17:20,888
BUT HERE'S THE THING -- I WAS 

7982
05:17:17,351 --> 05:17:24,758
EMAILING WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS 

7983
05:17:20,954 --> 05:17:28,929
WHO WAS CRITICIZIING THEM FOR 

7984
05:17:24,825 --> 05:17:30,030
THAT AND HE SAID 20 YEARS AGO 

7985
05:17:28,996 --> 05:17:30,464
BUFFET WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THOSE 

7986
05:17:30,097 --> 05:17:31,398
MISTAKES.

7987
05:17:30,531 --> 05:17:33,634
HE WOULD HAVE PLAYED OFFENSE.

7988
05:17:31,465 --> 05:17:35,603
I SAID, TRUE, BUT THE BUFFET OF 

7989
05:17:33,700 --> 05:17:36,537
THE 20 YEARS AGO HAD A RULE, NO 

7990
05:17:35,669 --> 05:17:39,039
TECH STOCKS.

7991
05:17:36,604 --> 05:17:41,108
SO I'M PERFECTLY FINE IF BUFFET 

7992
05:17:39,106 --> 05:17:42,843
MAKES A COMBINED $15 BILLION 

7993
05:17:41,175 --> 05:17:43,143
MISTAKE ON AIRLINES AND ON THE 

7994
05:17:42,910 --> 05:17:45,245
BANKS.

7995
05:17:43,210 --> 05:17:47,481
BUT HE'S MADE OVER $100 BILLION 

7996
05:17:45,312 --> 05:17:50,584
IN PROFITS FROM BERKSHIRE'S 

7997
05:17:47,548 --> 05:17:53,587
SHAREHOLDER JUST ON APPLE.

7998
05:17:50,651 --> 05:17:53,787
I'LL TAKE THAT TRADE ALL DAY 

7999
05:17:53,654 --> 05:17:55,522
LONG. 

8000
05:17:53,854 --> 05:17:57,291
>> ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF THE 

8001
05:17:55,589 --> 05:17:59,493
ANNUAL MEETING AND OF WARREN AND

8002
05:17:57,358 --> 05:18:01,361
CHARLIE IS THAT THEY TALK VERY 

8003
05:17:59,560 --> 05:18:03,263
OPENLY AND TRANSPARENCY ABOUT 

8004
05:18:01,428 --> 05:18:05,566
THEIR MISTAKES, SO A LOT OF 

8005
05:18:03,330 --> 05:18:06,933
FOLKS ARE CERTAINLY LEARNING 

8006
05:18:05,632 --> 05:18:08,468
FROM THEM, AND SO ONE OF THE 

8007
05:18:07,000 --> 05:18:10,604
THINGS THAT STOOD OUT TO ME -- 

8008
05:18:08,535 --> 05:18:12,907
FELT LIKE A TRADITIONAL MEETING 

8009
05:18:10,670 --> 05:18:15,309
IN A LOT OF WAYS BUT FOCUSES ON 

8010
05:18:12,973 --> 05:18:19,113
THE RISING RETAIL INVESTOR CLASS

8011
05:18:15,376 --> 05:18:19,580
AND SHARING THEIR LESSONS WITH 

8012
05:18:19,180 --> 05:18:20,881
THEM.

8013
05:18:19,647 --> 05:18:23,417
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT 

8014
05:18:20,948 --> 05:18:24,084
AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN INVOLVE IN

8015
05:18:23,484 --> 05:18:25,318
THE FINANCIAL EDUCATION AS THEY 

8016
05:18:24,151 --> 05:18:27,087
TALK ABOUT THE WORLD CHANGING, 

8017
05:18:25,385 --> 05:18:28,822
BRINGS THINGS UP FROM 30 YEARS 

8018
05:18:27,154 --> 05:18:31,424
AGO AND HOW THOSE STOCK, THEY'RE

8019
05:18:28,889 --> 05:18:32,059
NOT EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE WELL 

8020
05:18:31,491 --> 05:18:35,295
KNOWN TODAY?

8021
05:18:32,126 --> 05:18:44,271
>> WELL, LOOK, ONE OF THE FIRST 

8022
05:18:35,362 --> 05:18:45,739
MEETINGS I EVER WENT TO WAS 

8023
05:18:44,338 --> 05:18:47,674
1999, 2000 RIGHT AT THE TOP OF 

8024
05:18:45,805 --> 05:18:47,974
THE BUBBLE WHEN THEY WERE 

8025
05:18:47,741 --> 05:18:49,409
CRITICIZED.

8026
05:18:48,041 --> 05:18:50,344
AND I WAS SHOUT FROM THE 

8027
05:18:49,476 --> 05:18:50,944
ROOFTOPS, THESE GUYS HAVE NOT 

8028
05:18:50,411 --> 05:18:52,679
LOST IT.

8029
05:18:51,011 --> 05:18:52,879
AND I'M DOING THE SAME THING 

8030
05:18:52,746 --> 05:18:55,782
TODAY.

8031
05:18:52,946 --> 05:18:56,049
IT'S AMAZING HOW HISTORY REPEATS

8032
05:18:55,849 --> 05:19:00,787
ITSELF.

8033
05:18:56,116 --> 05:19:01,721
I THINK THEY WERE MOSTLY LA

8034
05:19:00,854 --> 05:19:05,959
LAMENTING, PARTICULARLY THE 

8035
05:19:01,788 --> 05:19:07,194
ROBIN HOOD APP AND THE CASINO 

8036
05:19:06,026 --> 05:19:09,196
NATURE OF INVESTING.

8037
05:19:07,261 --> 05:19:11,532
THEY JUST SHOOK THEIR HEAD AND 

8038
05:19:09,263 --> 05:19:14,034
SAID INVESTORS -- BUFFET WENT ON

8039
05:19:11,599 --> 05:19:16,703
A RIP ABOUT BUYING AND SELLING 

8040
05:19:14,101 --> 05:19:16,970
CALL AND PUT OPTIONS ON APPLE 

8041
05:19:16,770 --> 05:19:19,373
STOCK.

8042
05:19:17,037 --> 05:19:19,640
IT'S JUST PURE SPECULATION, PURE

8043
05:19:19,440 --> 05:19:21,041
GAMBLING.

8044
05:19:19,707 --> 05:19:22,543
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY 

8045
05:19:21,108 --> 05:19:25,546
ACTUALLY QUITE CAME OUT AND SAID

8046
05:19:22,610 --> 05:19:27,548
IT, BUT I FOR SURE HEARD IT.

8047
05:19:25,613 --> 05:19:29,516
THEY SAID, THIS IS GOING TO END 

8048
05:19:27,615 --> 05:19:31,785
BADLY, AND A LOT OF INNOCENT 

8049
05:19:29,583 --> 05:19:33,820
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T EXPERIENCE THE

8050
05:19:31,852 --> 05:19:36,290
INTERNET BUBBLE AND HOUSING 

8051
05:19:33,887 --> 05:19:36,590
BUBBLE BURSTING ARE GOING TO GET

8052
05:19:36,357 --> 05:19:38,758
INCINERATED.

8053
05:19:36,657 --> 05:19:40,727
BUT THEY MAKE NO PREDICTION AS 

8054
05:19:38,825 --> 05:19:42,563
TO WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN. 

8055
05:19:40,794 --> 05:19:45,766
>> APPLE ONE OF THOSE NAMES THAT

8056
05:19:42,630 --> 05:19:46,566
CAME UP IN ONE QUESTION WHERE 

8057
05:19:45,833 --> 05:19:48,201
THEY ASKED SPECIFICALLY WARREN 

8058
05:19:46,633 --> 05:19:49,970
BUFFET WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS A 

8059
05:19:48,268 --> 05:19:52,072
MISTAKE TO SELL SOME SHARES LAST

8060
05:19:50,037 --> 05:19:52,873
YEAR WHEN WE'VE SEEN STOCK GO UP

8061
05:19:52,139 --> 05:19:54,708
SINCE THEN.

8062
05:19:52,940 --> 05:19:56,343
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO 

8063
05:19:54,775 --> 05:19:56,977
SY AND I'LL GET YOUR THOUGHTS 

8064
05:19:56,410 --> 05:19:58,612
ON THE OTHER END. 

8065
05:19:57,044 --> 05:20:02,716
>> IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY 

8066
05:19:58,679 --> 05:20:12,292
BUSINESS, BUT I DO WANT TO 

8067
05:20:08,922 --> 05:20:15,929
IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY, BUT TIM --

8068
05:20:12,359 --> 05:20:17,564
COOK IS -- WE SEE A LOT OF 

8069
05:20:15,996 --> 05:20:18,999
MANAGER OF A LOT OF 

8070
05:20:17,631 --> 05:20:20,834
BUSINESSES -- YOU'RE LOOKING AT 

8071
05:20:19,066 --> 05:20:21,034
TWO GREAT ONES ON BOTH ENDS 

8072
05:20:20,900 --> 05:20:24,104
HERE.

8073
05:20:21,101 --> 05:20:24,337
HE'S HANDLED THAT BUSINESS SO 

8074
05:20:24,171 --> 05:20:28,242
WELL.

8075
05:20:24,404 --> 05:20:32,779
HE COULDN'T DO WHAT STEVE JOBS, 

8076
05:20:28,309 --> 05:20:35,983
OBVIOUSLY, COULD DO IN TERMS OF 

8077
05:20:32,846 --> 05:20:39,152
CREATION, BUT STEVE JOBS 

8078
05:20:36,050 --> 05:20:41,655
COULDN'T, REALLY,ENING YO, DO 

8079
05:20:39,219 --> 05:20:41,922
WHAT TIM COOK HAS DONE IN MANY 

8080
05:20:41,722 --> 05:20:43,723
RESPECTS. 

8081
05:20:41,989 --> 05:20:46,793
>> WE HEARD WARREN BUFFET SAY 

8082
05:20:43,790 --> 05:20:47,928
THAT APPLE HAS A PRODUCT THAT IS

8083
05:20:46,860 --> 05:20:49,362
INDISPENSABLE TO PEOPLE.

8084
05:20:47,995 --> 05:20:51,965
SORT OF COMPARE IT TO THE COST 

8085
05:20:49,429 --> 05:20:52,198
OF A CAR VERSUS THE COST OF AN 

8086
05:20:52,032 --> 05:20:54,768
iPHONE.

8087
05:20:52,265 --> 05:20:55,001
HOW MUCH MORE WE RELY ON APPLE 

8088
05:20:54,835 --> 05:20:58,705
DEVICES.

8089
05:20:55,068 --> 05:21:00,173
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HOW HE 

8090
05:20:58,772 --> 05:21:02,776
WEIGHED IN ON THIS OPENING 

8091
05:21:00,240 --> 05:21:03,811
SAYING, LOOK, SELLING APPLE WAS 

8092
05:21:02,843 --> 05:21:05,545
PROBABLY A MISTAKE. 

8093
05:21:03,877 --> 05:21:07,781
>> ANY TIME YOU SELL A STOCK AND

8094
05:21:05,612 --> 05:21:10,183
IT SUBSEQUENT BY GOES UP, YOU 

8095
05:21:07,848 --> 05:21:12,686
SORT OF MAYBE WISH YOU DIDN'T 

8096
05:21:10,250 --> 05:21:14,121
SELL IT, EVEN THOUGH THAT'S 

8097
05:21:12,753 --> 05:21:16,423
PRUDENT RISK MANAGEMENT.

8098
05:21:14,188 --> 05:21:18,525
INSTEAD OF BEMOANING THE FACT HE

8099
05:21:16,490 --> 05:21:23,030
SOLD 5% OF HIS APPLE POSITION, 

8100
05:21:18,592 --> 05:21:28,135
HE HELD ON TO 95%.

8101
05:21:23,097 --> 05:21:28,469
AND CONSEQUENTLY -- OVER 

8102
05:21:28,202 --> 05:21:32,138
$100 BILLION.

8103
05:21:28,535 --> 05:21:33,540
AND I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCELE I 

8104
05:21:32,205 --> 05:21:37,611
BOUGHT APPLE WAY BACK WHEN.

8105
05:21:33,607 --> 05:21:39,512
IT WENT UP 20%, AND I SOLD IT.

8106
05:21:37,678 --> 05:21:40,247
APPLE IS NOT A TYPICAL 

8107
05:21:39,579 --> 05:21:41,615
INVESTMENT FOR BUFFET.

8108
05:21:40,314 --> 05:21:43,750
IT'S A TECH STOCK.

8109
05:21:41,682 --> 05:21:45,251
AFTER THE FIRST BUBBLE, YOU 

8110
05:21:43,817 --> 05:21:51,725
THINK HE WOULD HAVE -- AND THE 

8111
05:21:45,318 --> 05:21:52,059
FACT THAT HE JUST -- IS WHAT'S 

8112
05:21:51,792 --> 05:21:54,127
EXTRAORDINARY.

8113
05:21:52,126 --> 05:21:55,762
WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING THAT, 

8114
05:21:54,194 --> 05:22:02,369
NOT CRITICIZING HE SOLD A FEW 

8115
05:21:55,829 --> 05:22:04,437
SHARES.

8116
05:22:02,436 --> 05:22:07,841
>> YEAH, YOU WANT TO JUMP IN 

8117
05:22:04,504 --> 05:22:09,609
HERE GUYS AND TALK A LITTLE BIT 

8118
05:22:07,908 --> 05:22:10,877
ABOUT THE THEMES WHITNEY'S BEEN 

8119
05:22:09,676 --> 05:22:12,612
HITTING ON?

8120
05:22:10,944 --> 05:22:13,680
GOING BACK TO THE FIRST SOUND WE

8121
05:22:12,679 --> 05:22:14,714
PLAYED WHERE BUFFET IS TALKING 

8122
05:22:13,747 --> 05:22:15,482
ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF ECONOMY 

8123
05:22:14,781 --> 05:22:16,950
RIGHT NOW.

8124
05:22:15,548 --> 05:22:19,052
AND THAT WAS FRAMED OUT OF A 

8125
05:22:17,017 --> 05:22:19,820
QUESTION ON, DID BERKSHIRE MISS 

8126
05:22:19,119 --> 05:22:22,355
AN OPPORTUNITY?

8127
05:22:19,887 --> 05:22:26,727
I THINK THE SHAREHOLDERS' 

8128
05:22:22,422 --> 05:22:29,929
QUESTION WAS, I'M INVESTING WITH

8129
05:22:26,794 --> 05:22:31,164
BERKSHIRE, WHICH HAS 

8130
05:22:29,996 --> 05:22:34,000
$100 BILLION ON THE SHEET.

8131
05:22:31,231 --> 05:22:35,802
YOU DIDN'T DEPLOY THAT.

8132
05:22:34,067 --> 05:22:38,872
WHITNEY, THIS IS YOUR 23rd.

8133
05:22:35,869 --> 05:22:40,340
THIS IS MY 6th MEETING BUT IT 

8134
05:22:38,939 --> 05:22:45,144
MADE ME THINK ABOUT THE 

8135
05:22:40,407 --> 05:22:45,812
QUESTIONS I TYPICALLY GET EVERY 

8136
05:22:45,211 --> 05:22:48,181
YEAR, WHICH ARE VERSIONS OF, WHY

8137
05:22:45,878 --> 05:22:48,348
DIDN'T YOU DO THING "X," THING 

8138
05:22:48,248 --> 05:22:50,450
"Y"?

8139
05:22:48,414 --> 05:22:50,784
I BROUGHT IT UP EARLIER IN THE 

8140
05:22:50,517 --> 05:22:52,385
PROGRAM.

8141
05:22:50,851 --> 05:22:54,921
WE DIDN'T HAVE WARREN BUFFET 

8142
05:22:52,452 --> 05:22:57,123
SITTING THERE AWAY HISTORY 

8143
05:22:54,988 --> 05:22:57,557
LESSON ABOUT THE ECONOMY SINCE 

8144
05:22:57,190 --> 05:22:59,293
WORLD WAR II.

8145
05:22:57,624 --> 05:23:00,627
HE WASN'T DEFENDING THE STATE OF

8146
05:22:59,359 --> 05:23:03,196
THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN A WAY I 

8147
05:23:00,693 --> 05:23:05,632
THINK HE'S GOTTEN USED TO OR 

8148
05:23:03,263 --> 05:23:08,835
ALMOST FELT THE NEED TO, AND I 

8149
05:23:05,699 --> 05:23:09,502
THOUGHT THAT WAS MAYBE A 

8150
05:23:08,902 --> 05:23:10,937
REFRESHING IS THE WORD THAT CAME

8151
05:23:09,569 --> 05:23:13,273
TO MY MIND, BECAUSE IT'S THE 

8152
05:23:11,004 --> 05:23:14,674
STUFF THAT COMES UP EVERY ANNUAL

8153
05:23:13,340 --> 05:23:18,011
MEETING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF 

8154
05:23:14,741 --> 05:23:19,312
SECOND GUESSING, BUFFET DOING 

8155
05:23:18,078 --> 05:23:21,114
HIS MACRO ANALYSIS.

8156
05:23:19,379 --> 05:23:22,882
WASN'T THE SAME THING AS LAST 

8157
05:23:21,181 --> 05:23:25,552
YEAR WHEN EVERYTHING, FOR 

8158
05:23:22,949 --> 05:23:27,354
OBVIOUS REASONS, BUT EVERYTHING 

8159
05:23:25,618 --> 05:23:28,655
WAS FRAMED THROUGH THE STATE OF 

8160
05:23:27,420 --> 05:23:29,790
THE PANDEMIC, WHAT'S GOING TO 

8161
05:23:28,722 --> 05:23:31,191
HAPPEN NEXT?

8162
05:23:29,857 --> 05:23:32,826
WARREN, PLEASE TELL US?

8163
05:23:31,258 --> 05:23:34,494
I THINK AS HE SAID -- WHAT WAS 

8164
05:23:32,893 --> 05:23:34,761
THAT JOKE FROM THE NEBRASKA 

8165
05:23:34,561 --> 05:23:36,730
GOVERNOR?

8166
05:23:34,828 --> 05:23:37,730
I'M ALL RIGHT WITH THAT ONE.

8167
05:23:36,796 --> 05:23:38,998
HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A COMMENT 

8168
05:23:37,797 --> 05:23:40,867
ON THAT LAST YEAR, AND IT WAS 

8169
05:23:39,065 --> 05:23:42,102
SORT OF THE ONLY THING THAT 

8170
05:23:40,934 --> 05:23:47,507
EVERYONE WANTED TO HEAR. 

8171
05:23:42,169 --> 05:23:48,875
>> YEAH, I WOULD JUST SAY, THIS 

8172
05:23:47,574 --> 05:23:51,177
IS THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IS 

8173
05:23:48,942 --> 05:23:52,212
THE THIRD BIG BUST IN THE 23 

8174
05:23:51,244 --> 05:23:55,549
YEARS I HAVE BEEN COMING.

8175
05:23:52,279 --> 05:23:58,351
THERE WAS THE AFTERMATH OF THE 

8176
05:23:55,616 --> 05:23:58,752
INTERNET BUBBLE, THE GLOBAL 

8177
05:23:58,418 --> 05:24:00,087
FINANCIAL CRISIS.

8178
05:23:58,818 --> 05:24:02,355
IT WAS REMARKABLE HOW SIMILAR 

8179
05:24:00,153 --> 05:24:03,857
THE TONE WAS A YEAR AGO, 

8180
05:24:02,422 --> 05:24:05,758
REASSURING PEOPLE, NEVER BET 

8181
05:24:03,924 --> 05:24:09,796
AGAINST AMERICA.

8182
05:24:05,825 --> 05:24:10,230
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK.

8183
05:24:09,863 --> 05:24:12,465
ST

8184
05:24:10,296 --> 05:24:14,200
 SIMILAR TO 2009 WHEN THE 

8185
05:24:12,532 --> 05:24:15,202
MEETING WAS A MONTH AFTER THE 

8186
05:24:14,267 --> 05:24:17,303
BOTTOM LIKE LAST YEAR.

8187
05:24:15,269 --> 05:24:18,838
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST MISTAKE 

8188
05:24:17,370 --> 05:24:20,406
INFORMSERS MAKE IS WE'RE TOO 

8189
05:24:18,905 --> 05:24:22,041
BEARISH AND ALWAYS SEEING THE 

8190
05:24:20,473 --> 05:24:23,776
NEXT STORM AND ALWAYS GETTING 

8191
05:24:22,108 --> 05:24:25,412
TOO DEFENSIVE AND SELLING OUR 

8192
05:24:23,843 --> 05:24:34,387
WINNERS TOO EARLY AND BUFFET TO 

8193
05:24:25,479 --> 05:24:35,622
HIS CREDIT HAS MANEINTAINED FOR0

8194
05:24:34,454 --> 05:24:37,824
PLUS YEAR OPTIMISM ABOUT AMERICA

8195
05:24:35,689 --> 05:24:39,126
AND PUT MONEY TO WORK WHEN OTHER

8196
05:24:37,891 --> 05:24:41,194
INVESTORS ARE PANICKING.

8197
05:24:39,192 --> 05:24:43,263
I WISH HE HAD DONE A LITTLE BIT 

8198
05:24:41,261 --> 05:24:44,998
MORE OF THAT A YEAR AGO, BUT 

8199
05:24:43,330 --> 05:24:46,533
GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT'S 

8200
05:24:45,065 --> 05:24:50,970
QUIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES.

8201
05:24:46,600 --> 05:24:52,906
HE HAS FUNDAMENT ALLY BEEN RIGH 

8202
05:24:51,037 --> 05:24:55,508
HIS ENTIRE REAR AND BEEN 

8203
05:24:52,973 --> 05:24:56,309
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA.

8204
05:24:55,575 --> 05:24:56,576
IT'S EASY NOW TO HAVE THAT 

8205
05:24:56,376 --> 05:24:57,176
VIEWPOINT.

8206
05:24:56,643 --> 05:24:59,479
IT WAS NOT A YEAR AGO, BUT HE 

8207
05:24:57,243 --> 05:25:00,146
WAS.

8208
05:24:59,546 --> 05:25:01,915
>> ALL RIGHT.

8209
05:25:00,213 --> 05:25:03,016

SHAREHOLDERS MEETING.

8224

A NUMBER OF ISSUES DISCUSSED 

8225
05:27:56,656 --> 05:28:02,395
TODAY, BUT ONE OF THE 

8226
05:28:00,527 --> 05:28:04,630
INTERESTING POINTS MADE BY 

8227
05:28:02,462 --> 05:28:07,267
WARREN BUFFET IS SORT OF GIVES 

8228
05:28:04,697 --> 05:28:08,935
ADVICE TO THOSE JUST DIPPING 

8229
05:28:07,333 --> 05:28:11,671
THEIR TOES IN THE MARKET.

8230
05:28:09,002 --> 05:28:12,839
HE MADE A COMPARISON TO TODAY 

8231
05:28:11,738 --> 05:28:15,275
VERSUS 1989.

8232
05:28:12,906 --> 05:28:16,109
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO 

8233
05:28:15,342 --> 05:28:17,644
SAY. 

8234
05:28:16,176 --> 05:28:19,412
>> 1989 WASN'T THE DARK AGES.

8235
05:28:17,711 --> 05:28:20,580
WE WEREN'T JUST DISCOVERING 

8236
05:28:19,479 --> 05:28:22,849
CAPITALISM OR ANYTHING ELSE, AND

8237
05:28:20,647 --> 05:28:24,717
PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY KNEW A LOT 

8238
05:28:22,916 --> 05:28:25,518
ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET AND THE 

8239
05:28:24,784 --> 05:28:30,490
EFFICIENT MARKET THEORY WAS IN.

8240
05:28:25,585 --> 05:28:33,493
IT WAS NOT A BACKWARD TIME.

8241
05:28:30,557 --> 05:28:39,398
AND IF YOU LOOK, THE TOP COMPANY

8242
05:28:33,560 --> 05:28:44,036
AT THE TIME HAD A MARKET OF -- 

8243
05:28:39,465 --> 05:28:47,640
SO THE LARGEST COMPANY IN THE 

8244
05:28:44,103 --> 05:28:48,341
WORLD HAS GONE FROM $100 MILLION

8245
05:28:47,707 --> 05:28:54,748
TO $2 TRILLION.

8246
05:28:48,408 --> 05:28:56,382
AT THE BOTTOM, THE NUMBER 20 HAS

8247
05:28:54,815 --> 05:28:57,483
GONE FROM 20 MILLION TO 

8248
05:28:56,449 --> 05:28:59,352
SOMETHING A LITTLE OVER TEN 

8249
05:28:57,550 --> 05:29:00,753
TIMES THAT.

8250
05:28:59,419 --> 05:29:04,491
WELL, THAT TELL US SOMETHING 

8251
05:29:00,820 --> 05:29:08,394
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED WE 

8252
05:29:04,557 --> 05:29:14,300
QUALITY, WHICH IS A HOT SUBJECT 

8253
05:29:08,461 --> 05:29:17,070
IN THIS CURRENT.

8254
05:29:14,367 --> 05:29:17,504
TELLS A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT 

8255
05:29:17,137 --> 05:29:20,206
INFLATION.

8256
05:29:17,571 --> 05:29:20,973
IT TELLS YOU THAT CAPITALISM 

8257
05:29:20,273 --> 05:29:30,917
WORKED INCREDIBLY WELL, 

8258
05:29:21,040 --> 05:29:32,385
ESPECIALLY FOR THE CAPITALISTS.

8259
05:29:30,984 --> 05:29:33,687
>> -- TODAY SAYING ESSENTIALLY 

8260
05:29:32,452 --> 05:29:35,755
HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE GOING TO 

8261
05:29:33,753 --> 05:29:36,856
BE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST 30 

8262
05:29:35,821 --> 05:29:41,161
YEARS FROM NOW.

8263
05:29:36,923 --> 05:29:41,561
HE WAS SAYING WE WERE AS SURE OF

8264
05:29:41,228 --> 05:29:45,198
OU

8265
05:29:41,628 --> 05:29:47,200
OURSELVES BACK IN 1989 AS WE ARE

8266
05:29:45,265 --> 05:29:47,734
TODAY BUT THE WORLD CAN CHANGE. 

8267
05:29:47,267 --> 05:29:51,938
>> INTERESTING.

8268
05:29:47,801 --> 05:29:53,773
BUFFET DID THE EXERCISE OF H

8269
05:29:52,005 --> 05:29:55,675
LOOKING AT THE MARKET CAPS AS HE

8270
05:29:53,840 --> 05:29:57,911
ALLUDED TO IN THAT CLIP.

8271
05:29:55,742 --> 05:29:59,378
EVERYONE SAW THE MEETING.

8272
05:29:57,978 --> 05:30:00,813
DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY ALL SEVEN 

8273
05:29:59,445 --> 05:30:02,381
MINUTES OF HIS ANSWER.

8274
05:30:00,880 --> 05:30:03,916
THE GREAT TAKEAWAY IS THIS IS A 

8275
05:30:02,448 --> 05:30:04,784
GREAT TIME TO BE AN INVESTOR IN 

8276
05:30:03,983 --> 05:30:06,319
THE SOCK MARKET.

8277
05:30:04,851 --> 05:30:07,486
THE VALUE OF THE BIGGEST 

8278
05:30:06,386 --> 05:30:09,922
COMPANIES IN THE STOCK MARKET, 

8279
05:30:07,553 --> 05:30:13,259
ABOUT 20 TIMES HIGHER TODAY -- 

8280
05:30:09,989 --> 05:30:15,495
OR AT LEAST AT THE VERY TOP, 

8281
05:30:13,326 --> 05:30:17,864
THAN IT WAS JUST 30 YEARS AGO.

8282
05:30:15,562 --> 05:30:19,131
BUT HIS LESSON, HIS ADVICE, AS 

8283
05:30:17,931 --> 05:30:20,767
TENDED TO BE THE CASE OVER THE 

8284
05:30:19,198 --> 05:30:23,135
LAST -- YOU KNOW, HE'S GOTTEN 

8285
05:30:20,833 --> 05:30:25,271
MORE VOCAL ABOUT IT IN THE LAST 

8286
05:30:23,202 --> 05:30:27,473
10 OR 15 YEARS IS THAT YOU HAVE 

8287
05:30:25,338 --> 05:30:28,641
AN OPTION AS AN INVESTOR TO JUST

8288
05:30:27,540 --> 05:30:30,910
BUY ALL THE STOCKS.

8289
05:30:28,708 --> 05:30:32,212
YOU CAN GET AN S&P 500 FUND 

8290
05:30:30,977 --> 05:30:34,247
BASICALLY FOR FREE.

8291
05:30:32,279 --> 05:30:37,017
I THINK IT COSTS THREE OR FOUR 

8292
05:30:34,314 --> 05:30:43,790
BASIS POINTS OVER AT VANGUARD, 

8293
05:30:37,083 --> 05:30:44,257
OR .3 OR .4 BASIS POINTS, EXCUSE

8294
05:30:43,857 --> 05:30:46,559
ME, OVER AT VANGUARD.

8295
05:30:44,324 --> 05:30:49,295
YOU'RE BUYING THE ENTIRE MARKET 

8296
05:30:46,626 --> 05:30:51,464
FOR FREE AND THE ENTIRE MARKET 

8297
05:30:49,362 --> 05:30:54,100
OVER TIME HAS GONE UP NICELY.

8298
05:30:51,531 --> 05:30:56,102
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ENGAGED IN 

8299
05:30:54,167 --> 05:30:56,969
TRYING TO GUESS WHICH OF THE 

8300
05:30:56,169 --> 05:30:59,906
BUSINESSES WILL BE LARGE OVER 

8301
05:30:57,036 --> 05:31:03,009
THE NEXT 30 YEARS BUT RATHER CAN

8302
05:30:59,973 --> 05:31:03,709
ACCESS ALL THE BUSINESSES AND 

8303
05:31:03,076 --> 05:31:06,046
ALL THE APPRECIATION THEY'RE 

8304
05:31:03,776 --> 05:31:09,416
LIKELY TO ENJOY OVER THE NEXT 30

8305
05:31:06,112 --> 05:31:10,016
YEARS WITHOUT HAVING TO ENGAGE 

8306
05:31:09,482 --> 05:31:11,217
IN THE VERY DIFFICULT JOB OF 

8307
05:31:10,083 --> 05:31:12,551
TRYING TO PICK INDIVIDUAL 

8308
05:31:11,284 --> 05:31:13,686
SECURITIES ON WHICH ONES ARE 

8309
05:31:12,618 --> 05:31:15,354
GOING TO PERFORM BEST. 

8310
05:31:13,753 --> 05:31:21,694
>> JULIA, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMED TO

8311
05:31:15,421 --> 05:31:22,828
BE A BIT OF A CAUTIONARY TALE 

8312
05:31:21,761 --> 05:31:23,229
HEAR THAT WARREN ONE BUFFET WAS 

8313
05:31:22,895 --> 05:31:25,564
TRYING TO TELL.

8314
05:31:23,296 --> 05:31:27,767
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT TRADERS 

8315
05:31:25,631 --> 05:31:27,967
LOOKING TO MAKE 30, 40 TRADES A 

8316
05:31:27,833 --> 05:31:30,804
DATE.

8317
05:31:28,034 --> 05:31:34,440
HE SAID, IF YOU LOOK BACK IN 

8318
05:31:30,870 --> 05:31:34,907
1989, THE BESTS IN 1989 DIDN'T 

8319
05:31:34,507 --> 05:31:36,175
NECESSARILY DO WELL. 

8320
05:31:34,974 --> 05:31:38,244
>> THAT'S RIGHT AND WHEN YOU 

8321
05:31:36,242 --> 05:31:39,712
LOOK AT THE COMPANIES I THINK 

8322
05:31:38,311 --> 05:31:41,447
THERE ARE ONLY SIX AMERICAN 

8323
05:31:39,779 --> 05:31:41,647
COMPANIES ON THAT LIST AT THE 

8324
05:31:41,514 --> 05:31:44,016
TIME.

8325
05:31:41,714 --> 05:31:45,751
THOSE SIX COMPANIES ARE NOWHERE 

8326
05:31:44,083 --> 05:31:47,654
TO BE FOUND ON TODAY'S LIST, 

8327
05:31:45,818 --> 05:31:49,088
WHICH IS DOMINATED BY AMERICAN 

8328
05:31:47,721 --> 05:31:50,123
COMPANIES, SPECIFICALLY SOME OF 

8329
05:31:49,155 --> 05:31:52,158
THOSE BIG TECH NAMES.

8330
05:31:50,190 --> 05:31:54,327
BUT KIND OF BUILDING ON WHAT 

8331
05:31:52,225 --> 05:31:56,095
MILES SAID, WARREN BUFFET HAS 

8332
05:31:54,394 --> 05:32:00,366
LONG ADVOCATED FOR INVESTORS 

8333
05:31:56,162 --> 05:32:00,866
BUYING THESE LOW-COST INDEX 

8334
05:32:00,433 --> 05:32:03,303
FUN

8335
05:32:00,933 --> 05:32:04,603
FUNDS RATHER THAN PAYING SOMEONE

8336
05:32:03,370 --> 05:32:05,972
MANAGEMENT FEES TO PICK THE NEW 

8337
05:32:04,670 --> 05:32:08,307
THING TO SELL THESE DAYS, 

8338
05:32:06,039 --> 05:32:09,742
WHETHER IT'S THE LATEST IPO OR 

8339
05:32:08,374 --> 05:32:11,911
LATEST CPAC.

8340
05:32:09,809 --> 05:32:13,879
AND THEN ONE OTHER SMALL THING I

8341
05:32:11,978 --> 05:32:16,682
WILL ADD, BECAUSE THE LATEST 

8342
05:32:13,946 --> 05:32:18,784
LIST HE DID SHOW FOR MARCH 2021 

8343
05:32:16,749 --> 05:32:19,986
WITH THOSE BIG TECH COMPANIES, 

8344
05:32:18,851 --> 05:32:21,988
LATER IN THE CONVERSATION, 

8345
05:32:20,053 --> 05:32:24,490
CHARLIE MUNGER DID BRING UP THAT

8346
05:32:22,055 --> 05:32:26,025
LIST AND POINT OUT THAT APPLE 

8347
05:32:24,557 --> 05:32:27,393
HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO 

8348
05:32:26,092 --> 05:32:28,528
AMERICA, AND WE'VE DONE SO WELL 

8349
05:32:27,460 --> 05:32:31,864
IN THIS NEW TECH FIELD.

8350
05:32:28,595 --> 05:32:33,632
AND HE ALSO SAID -- MUNGER SAID 

8351
05:32:31,931 --> 05:32:35,034
HE WOULD NOT LIKE TO PRESENT 

8352
05:32:33,699 --> 05:32:37,203
GIANTS BE BROUGHT DOWN TO LOW 

8353
05:32:35,101 --> 05:32:37,503
LEVEL BY ANTI-COMPETITIVE 

8354
05:32:37,270 --> 05:32:38,838
REASONINGS.

8355
05:32:37,570 --> 05:32:42,375
JUST AN INTERESTING POINT HE 

8356
05:32:38,905 --> 05:32:43,042
BROUGHT UP LATER IN THE MEANING 

8357
05:32:42,441 --> 05:32:44,944
THAT HE'S VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT 

8358
05:32:43,109 --> 05:32:48,314
OF THESE BIG TECH COMPANIES 

8359
05:32:45,011 --> 05:32:48,748
WHICH HAVE BEEN UNDER A LOT OF 

8360
05:32:48,381 --> 05:32:49,983
SC

8361
05:32:48,814 --> 05:32:51,985
SCRUTINY LATELY. 

8362
05:32:50,050 --> 05:32:54,020
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, JULIA.

8363
05:32:52,052 --> 05:32:54,921
ANDY I WONDER WHAT YOU MADE 

8364
05:32:54,087 --> 05:32:56,723
ABOUT THOSE COMMENTS.

8365
05:32:54,987 --> 05:32:59,858
THEY WERE ALSO ASKED ABOUT 

8366
05:32:56,790 --> 05:33:01,861
VALUATIONS, WHETHER THEY THOUGHT

8367
05:32:59,925 --> 05:33:03,062
THEY WERE TOO SKY HIGH.

8368
05:33:01,928 --> 05:33:04,263
DIDN'T SOUND LIKE THEY THOUGHT 

8369
05:33:03,129 --> 05:33:06,666
THEY WERE IN HE TALKED ABOUT 

8370
05:33:04,330 --> 05:33:08,701
THAT RELATIVE TO INTEREST RATES,

8371
05:33:06,733 --> 05:33:10,870
AKIKO, SAYING YOU'VE GOT 

8372
05:33:08,768 --> 05:33:14,007
INTEREST RATES AT THIS LEVEL, IT

8373
05:33:10,937 --> 05:33:14,307
MAKES STOCKS LOOK MUCH LESS 

8374
05:33:14,074 --> 05:33:15,441
EXPENSIVE.

8375
05:33:14,374 --> 05:33:17,910
YOU DIVERSE INTO NEGATIVE 

8376
05:33:15,508 --> 05:33:18,945
INTEREST RATES, SOME INTERESTING

8377
05:33:17,977 --> 05:33:21,080
THINGS THERE.

8378
05:33:19,012 --> 05:33:22,515
ANOTHER THING THAT CAUGHT MY EAR

8379
05:33:21,147 --> 05:33:24,550
WAS HIS DISCUSSION OF AUTO 

8380
05:33:22,582 --> 05:33:26,652
STOCKS AND THE HUNDREDS OF AUTO 

8381
05:33:24,617 --> 05:33:31,891
STOCKS THAT EXISTED 100 YEARS OR

8382
05:33:26,719 --> 05:33:33,193
SO IN THIS COUNTRY AND HOW THEY 

8383
05:33:31,958 --> 05:33:33,493
ALL TURNED OUT TO BE BAD 

8384
05:33:33,259 --> 05:33:34,427
INVESTMENTS.

8385
05:33:33,560 --> 05:33:35,895
THAT WAS INTERESTING.

8386
05:33:34,494 --> 05:33:37,464
ANOTHER POINT I THOUGHT WAS 

8387
05:33:35,962 --> 05:33:41,634
INTERESTING WAS HIS TAKE LATE IN

8388
05:33:37,530 --> 05:33:45,237
THE MEETING ABOUT SHORTAGES.

8389
05:33:41,700 --> 05:33:46,739
GREG ALSO CHAMI CHIMING IN THER 

8390
05:33:45,304 --> 05:33:48,708
SAYING THE ECONOMY WAS HOT.

8391
05:33:46,806 --> 05:33:49,875
BUFFET SAID IT WAS RED-HOT, AS A

8392
05:33:48,775 --> 05:33:52,612
MATTER OF FACT, AND THAT THERE 

8393
05:33:49,942 --> 05:33:54,280
IS UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICING 

8394
05:33:52,678 --> 05:33:56,782
THEY'RE SEEING THROUGHOUT THE 

8395
05:33:54,347 --> 05:33:57,049
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ECOSYSTEM, IF

8396
05:33:56,849 --> 05:33:58,918
YOU WILL.

8397
05:33:57,116 --> 05:33:59,752
SO A LOT TO CHEW ON THERE FOR 

8398
05:33:58,985 --> 05:34:02,422
INVESTORS IN BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY 

8399
05:33:59,819 --> 05:34:03,756
AND INVESTORS IN GENERAL.

8400
05:34:02,488 --> 05:34:03,923
MUCH MORE TO DISCUSS HERE COMING

8401
05:34:03,823 --> 05:34:05,191
UP.

8402
05:34:03,989 --> 05:34:05,392
BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

8403
05:34:05,258 --> 05:34:07,127
BREAK.

8404
05:34:05,458 --> 05:34:07,127
STAY TUNED, AND MORE TO COME.

8405
05:36:23,963 --> 05:36:28,133
>>> WELCOME BACK TO THE 2021 

8406
05:36:27,133 --> 05:36:31,737
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ANNUAL 

8407
05:36:28,200 --> 05:36:32,004
MEETING SHAREHOLDERS POSTGAME 

8408
05:36:31,804 --> 05:36:34,440
PROGRAM.

8409
05:36:32,071 --> 05:36:38,644
BUFFET TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE 

8410
05:36:34,507 --> 05:36:39,745
STIMULUS WE HAD OVER THE PAST 12

8411
05:36:38,711 --> 05:36:40,146
MONTHS AND THAT EFFECT ON THE 

8412
05:36:39,812 --> 05:36:41,714
ECONOMY.

8413
05:36:40,213 --> 05:36:42,281
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO 

8414
05:36:41,781 --> 05:36:44,350
SAY HERE. 

8415
05:36:42,348 --> 05:36:47,586
>> IT'S A FASCINATING TIME.

8416
05:36:44,417 --> 05:36:49,722
WE'VE NEVER REALLY SEEN WHAT 

8417
05:36:47,653 --> 05:36:52,725
SHOVELING MONEY IN ON A BASIS 

8418
05:36:49,789 --> 05:36:54,860
WE'RE DOING IT OFF, ON A FISCAL 

8419
05:36:52,792 --> 05:37:00,266
BASIS FOLLOWING A MONETARY 

8420
05:36:54,927 --> 05:37:02,401
POLICY OF SOMETHING CLOSE TO 0% 

8421
05:37:00,332 --> 05:37:03,169
INTEREST RATES, AND IT IS 

8422
05:37:02,468 --> 05:37:06,539
ENORMOUSLY PLEASANT.

8423
05:37:03,235 --> 05:37:07,806
BUT IN ECONOMICS YOU HAVE TO 

8424
05:37:06,606 --> 05:37:08,340
REMEMBER, YOU CAN NEVER DO ONLY 

8425
05:37:07,873 --> 05:37:11,043
ONE THING.

8426
05:37:08,407 --> 05:37:11,243
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO SAY AND THEN 

8427
05:37:11,110 --> 05:37:13,779
WHAT?

8428
05:37:11,310 --> 05:37:15,815
AND WE'RE SENDING OUT HUGE SUMS.

8429
05:37:13,846 --> 05:37:17,283
I MEAN, THE PRESIDENT SAID IT ON

8430
05:37:15,882 --> 05:37:21,721
WEDNESDAY -- 85% OF THE PEOPLE 

8431
05:37:17,350 --> 05:37:21,921
ARE GOING TO GET A $1,400 CHECK.

8432
05:37:21,788 --> 05:37:23,923
85%.

8433
05:37:21,988 --> 05:37:27,292
AND A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE 

8434
05:37:23,989 --> 05:37:28,661
WERE SAYING 40% OF THE PEOPLE 

8435
05:37:27,359 --> 05:37:32,297
WOULD NEVER COME UP WITH $400 IN

8436
05:37:28,728 --> 05:37:34,033
CASH SOME WE'VE GOT 8 5% OF THE 

8437
05:37:32,364 --> 05:37:37,403
PEOPLE GETTING THOSE SUMS AND SO

8438
05:37:34,100 --> 05:37:39,171
FAR WE HAVE HAD NO UNPLEASANT 

8439
05:37:37,470 --> 05:37:39,872
CONSEQUENCES.

8440
05:37:39,238 --> 05:37:41,574
PEOPLE FEEL BETTER.

8441
05:37:39,939 --> 05:37:41,807
PEOPLE GET THE MONEY, FEEL 

8442
05:37:41,641 --> 05:37:43,242
BETTER.

8443
05:37:41,874 --> 05:37:45,244
PEOPLE LESSONING MONEY DON'T 

8444
05:37:43,309 --> 05:37:47,413
FEEL VERY GOOD, BUT IT CAUSES 

8445
05:37:45,311 --> 05:37:48,881
STOCKS TO GO UP, CAUSES 

8446
05:37:47,480 --> 05:37:52,017
BUSINESSES TO FLOURISH.

8447
05:37:48,948 --> 05:37:54,253
IT CAUSES AN ELECTORATE TO BE 

8448
05:37:52,084 --> 05:37:57,189
HAPPY, AND WE'LL SEE IF IT CAUSE

8449
05:37:54,320 --> 05:37:59,091
ANYTHING ELSE.

8450
05:37:57,256 --> 05:38:02,628
IF IT DOESN'T CAUSE ANYTHING 

8451
05:37:59,158 --> 05:38:03,362
ELSE YOU CAN COUNT ON IT 

8452
05:38:02,695 --> 05:38:04,897
CONTINUE.

8453
05:38:03,429 --> 05:38:06,332
BUT, NO, THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES 

8454
05:38:04,964 --> 05:38:08,333
TO EVERYTHING IN ECONOMICS. 

8455
05:38:06,399 --> 05:38:10,336
>> WHITNEY TILSON I WANT TO GO 

8456
05:38:08,400 --> 05:38:12,705
TO YOU AND GET YOUR REACTION TO 

8457
05:38:10,403 --> 05:38:14,440
WHAT BUFFET JUST SAID ABOUT 

8458
05:38:12,772 --> 05:38:15,340
STIMULUS AND THE EFFECT ON 

8459
05:38:14,507 --> 05:38:17,509
ECONOMY AND MARKETS?

8460
05:38:15,407 --> 05:38:19,611
>> RIGHT AFTER THAT, MUNGER 

8461
05:38:17,576 --> 05:38:21,447
WEIGHED IN AND SAID, IF IT 

8462
05:38:19,678 --> 05:38:23,682
CONTINUES FOR TOO LONG, THE 

8463
05:38:21,514 --> 05:38:25,751
CONSEQUENCE WILL BE TERRIBLE, 

8464
05:38:23,749 --> 05:38:28,420
FURTHER MAKING BUFFET'S POINT.

8465
05:38:25,818 --> 05:38:32,224
BUT IT REALLY REFLECTS THEIR 

8466
05:38:28,487 --> 05:38:34,126
HUMILITY IN THAT WHO COULD HAVE 

8467
05:38:32,291 --> 05:38:35,861
EVER EXPECTED ANY OF THIS?

8468
05:38:34,193 --> 05:38:37,496
THEY SAID AT ONE POINT IT'S JUST

8469
05:38:35,928 --> 05:38:39,565
THE MOST REMARKABLE TIME IN 

8470
05:38:37,563 --> 05:38:41,633
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TO JUST SIT 

8471
05:38:39,632 --> 05:38:44,771
BECOME AND BE A SPECTATOR AND 

8472
05:38:41,700 --> 05:38:45,604
LOOK A WHAT'S GOING ON.

8473
05:38:44,837 --> 05:38:47,606
AND THEY ARE BASICALLY -- TO BE 

8474
05:38:45,671 --> 05:38:49,675
A SUCCESSFUL INVESTOR YOU HAVE 

8475
05:38:47,673 --> 05:38:51,143
TO BE VERY ARROGANT TO BELIEVE 

8476
05:38:49,742 --> 05:38:52,578
THAT YOU CAN OUTWIT ALL THE 

8477
05:38:51,210 --> 05:38:54,546
OTHER INVESTORS OUT THERE.

8478
05:38:52,645 --> 05:38:56,648
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A 

8479
05:38:54,613 --> 05:38:59,184
TREMENDOUS HUMILITY, AND THEY 

8480
05:38:56,715 --> 05:39:00,686
OUTLINED THIS INCREDIBLE PUZZLE.

8481
05:38:59,251 --> 05:39:00,919
THEY DON'T CLAIM TO HAVE THE 

8482
05:39:00,753 --> 05:39:02,521
ANSWERS.

8483
05:39:00,986 --> 05:39:05,291
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW THE STORY'S 

8484
05:39:02,588 --> 05:39:06,291
GOING END, BUT THEY'RE ENJOYING 

8485
05:39:05,358 --> 05:39:08,093
THE SHOW, AND IN THE MEANTIME 

8486
05:39:06,358 --> 05:39:10,329
THEY HAVE THEIR HEADS DOWN, 

8487
05:39:08,160 --> 05:39:13,198
LOOKING TO BUY BACK THEIR OWN 

8488
05:39:10,396 --> 05:39:14,667
STACK, MAKE ACQUISITIONS, BUY 

8489
05:39:13,265 --> 05:39:16,935
STOCKS IN THE MARKET AND DO WHAT

8490
05:39:14,734 --> 05:39:19,204
THEY'VE ALWAYS DONE AND THEY'RE 

8491
05:39:17,002 --> 05:39:19,671
NOT TEMPTED TO STRAY FROM WHAT 

8492
05:39:19,271 --> 05:39:22,141
THEY'VE ALWAYS DONE.

8493
05:39:19,738 --> 05:39:22,308
IT'S A GOOD LESSON FOR ALL OF 

8494
05:39:22,208 --> 05:39:24,944
US. 

8495
05:39:22,374 --> 05:39:25,144
>> AKIKO, YOU HAD A TAKE ON 

8496
05:39:25,011 --> 05:39:26,545
THIS.

8497
05:39:25,211 --> 05:39:26,846
SOME FINAL THOUGHTS GOING 

8498
05:39:26,612 --> 05:39:27,513
AROUND.

8499
05:39:26,913 --> 05:39:29,548
YOU FIRST. 

8500
05:39:27,580 --> 05:39:30,315
>> TO WHITNEY'S POINT, THEY WERE

8501
05:39:29,615 --> 05:39:32,017
ANSWERING A QUESTION THAT CAME 

8502
05:39:30,382 --> 05:39:35,020
IN AND SAID, WHY DID YOU JUST 

8503
05:39:32,084 --> 05:39:36,822
SIT ON YOUR HAND HERE WHEN THERE

8504
05:39:35,087 --> 05:39:37,089
WERE MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE 

8505
05:39:36,889 --> 05:39:40,292
MARKET?

8506
05:39:37,156 --> 05:39:40,492
I THINK WHITNEY BRINGS UP A GOOD

8507
05:39:40,359 --> 05:39:42,361
POINT.

8508
05:39:40,559 --> 05:39:46,899
WE HEARD WARREN BUFFET AS WELL 

8509
05:39:42,428 --> 05:39:47,900
AS CHARLIE MUNGER SAYING, LOOK, 

8510
05:39:46,966 --> 05:39:48,100
THE ECONOMY RUNNING IN HIGH 

8511
05:39:47,967 --> 05:39:49,469
GEAR.

8512
05:39:48,167 --> 05:39:51,003
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US COULD 

8513
05:39:49,535 --> 05:39:53,939
HAVE PREDICTED THAT.

8514
05:39:51,070 --> 05:39:55,007
I THOUGHT THEIR PGS ON THE 

8515
05:39:54,006 --> 05:39:55,307
AIRLINES WERE INTERESTING AS 

8516
05:39:55,074 --> 05:39:56,809
WELL.

8517
05:39:55,374 --> 05:39:58,811
THEY HAVE GOTTEN SOME HEAT.

8518
05:39:56,876 --> 05:40:01,513
WE HEARD WARREN BUFFET SAY, 

8519
05:39:58,878 --> 05:40:04,850
LOOK, THEY WERE THE BIG 

8520
05:40:01,580 --> 05:40:07,219
BENEFICIARIES OF THE C.A.R.E.S. 

8521
05:40:04,917 --> 05:40:08,721
ACT, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY 

8522
05:40:07,286 --> 05:40:12,558
THEY WOULD HAVE STUCK TO THEIR 

8523
05:40:08,788 --> 05:40:16,295
POSITIONS, PULLING OUT OF 

8524
05:40:12,625 --> 05:40:16,562
AIRLINE STOCKS AND PARING BACK 

8525
