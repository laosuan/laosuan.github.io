## Text1

The longest bull run in a century of art-market history ended on a dramatic note with a sale of 56 works by Damien Hirst, “Beautiful Inside My Head Forever”, at Sotheby’s in London on September 15th 2008 (see picture). All but two pieces sold, fetching more than ￡70m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last hurrah. As the auctioneer called out bids, in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy.

The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising vertiginously since 2003. At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons Clare McAndrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm-double the figure five years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos, greed, passion and controversy in a way matched by few other industries.

In the weeks and months that followed Mr Hirst’s sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable, especially in New York, where the bail-out of the banks coincided with the loss of thousands of jobs and the financial demise of many art-buying investors. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector-for Chinese contemporary art-they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world’s two biggest auction houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them.

The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of 1989, a move that started the most serious contraction in the market since the second world war. This time experts reckon that prices are about 40% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more volatile. But Edward Dolman, Christie’s chief executive, says: “I’m pretty confident we’re at the bottom.”

What makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the market, whereas in the early 1990s, when interest rates were high, there was no demand even though many collectors wanted to sell. Christie’s revenues in the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006. Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell. The three Ds-death, debt and divorce-still deliver works of art to the market. But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.

21.In the first paragraph,Damien Hirst's sale was referred to as “a last victory”because ____.

A.the art market hadwitnessed a succession of victoryies

B.the auctioneer finally got the two pieces at the highest bids

C.Beautiful Inside My Head Forever won over all masterpieces

D.it was successfully made just before the world financial crisis

22.By saying “spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable”(Line 1-2,Para.3),the author suggests that_____ .

A . collectors were no longer actively involved in art-market auctions

B .people stopped every kind of spending and stayed away from galleries

C.art collection as a fashion had lost its appeal to a great extent

D .works of art in general had gone out of fashion so they were not worth buying

23.Which of the following statements is NOT ture?

A .Sales of contemporary art fell dramatically from 2007to 2008.

B.The art market surpassed many other industries in momentum.

C.The market generally went downward in various ways.

D.Some art dealers were awaiting better chances to come.

24.The three Ds mentioned in the last paragraph are ____

A.auction houses ' favorites

B.contemporary trends

C.factors promoting artwork circulation

D.styles representing impressionists

25.The most appropriate title for this text could be ___

A.Fluctuation of Art Prices

B.Up-to-date Art Auctions

C.Art Market in Decline

D.Shifted Interest in Arts

## Text 2

I was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room -- a women's group that had invited men to join them. Throughout the evening one man had been particularly talkative frequently offering ideas and anecdotes while his wife sat silently beside him on the couch. Toward the end of the evening I commented that women frequently complain that their husbands don't talk to them. This man quickly concurred. He gestured toward his wife and said "She's the talker in our family." The room burst into laughter; the man looked puzzled and hurt. "It's true" he explained. "When I come home from work I have nothing to say. If she didn't keep the conversation going we'd spend the whole evening in silence."

This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in public situations they often talk less at home. And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage.

The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late '70s. Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book "Divorce Talk" that most of the women she interviewed -- but only a few of the men -- gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces. Given the current divorce rate of nearly 50 percent that amounts to millions of cases in the United States every year -- a virtual epidemic of failed conversation.

In my own research complaints from women about their husbands most often focused not on tangible inequities such as having given up the chance for a career to accompany a husband to his or doing far more than their share of daily life-support work like cleaning cooking social arrangements and errands. Instead they focused on communication: "He doesn't listen to me" "He doesn't talk to me." I found as Hacker observed years before that most wives want their husbands to be first and foremost conversational partners but few husbands share this expectation of their wives.

In short the image that best represents the current crisis is the stereotypical cartoon scene of a man sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front of his face while a woman glares at the back of it wanting to talk.

26.What is most wives' main expectation of their husbands?

A.Talking to them.

B.Trusting them.

C.Supporting their careers.

D. Shsring housework.

27.Judging from the context ,the phrase “wreaking havoc”(Line 3,Para.2)most probably means ___ .

A generating motivation.

B.exerting influence

C.causing damage

Dcreating pressure

28.All of the following are true EXCEPT_______

A.men tend to talk more in public tan women

B.nearly 50percent of recent divorces are caused by failed conversation

C.women attach much importance to communication between couples

Da female tends to be more talkative at home than her spouse

29.Which of the following can best summarize the mian idea of this text ?

A.The moral decaying deserves more research by sociologists .

B.Marriage break_up stems from sex inequalities.

C.Husband and wofe have different expectations from their marriage.

D.Conversational patterns between man and wife are different.

30.In the following part immediately after this text,the author will most probably focus on ______

A.a vivid account of the new book Divorce Talk

B.a detailed description of the stereotypical cartoon

C.other possible reasons for a high divorce rate in the U.S.

D a brief introduction to the political scientist Andrew Hacker

## Txet 3

over the past decade, many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behaviors - habits - among consumers. These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks, apply lotions and wipe counters almost without thinking, often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues.

“There are fundamental public health problems, like hand washing with soap, that remain killers only because we can’t figure out how to change people’s habits,” Dr. Curtis said. “We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.”

The companies that Dr. Curtis turned to - Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever - had invested hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers’ lives that corporations could use to introduce new routines.

If you look hard enough, you’ll find that many of the products we use every day - chewing gums, skin moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, antiperspirants, colognes, teeth whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins - are results of manufactured habits. A century ago, few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of canny advertising and public health campaigns, many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity-preventing scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or one of the other brands.

A few decades ago, many people didn’t drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies started bottling the production of far-off springs,and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long. Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals,slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup.

“Our products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns,” said Carol Berning, a consumer psychologist who recently retired from Procter & Gamble, the company that sold $76 billion of Tide, Crest and other products last year. “Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers’ lives, and it’s essential to making new products commercially viable.”

Through experiments and observation, social scientists like Dr. Berning have learned that there is power in tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through relentless advertising. As this new science of habit has emerged, controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy foods.

31.According to Dr.Curtis,habits like hand washing with soap________.

[A] should be further cultivated

[B] should be changed gradually

[C] are deepiy rooted in history

[D] are basically private concerns

32.Bottled water,chewing gun and skin moisturizers are mentioned in Paragraph 5 so as to____

[A] reveal their impact on people’habits

[B] show the urgent need of daily necessities

[C]indicate their effect on people’buying power

[D]manifest the significant role of good habits

33.which of the following does NOT belong to products that help create people’s habits?

[A]Tide

[B]Crest

[C]Colgate

[D]Unilver

34.From the text wekonw that some of consumer’s habits are developed due to _____

[A]perfected art of products

[B]automatic behavior creation

[C]commercial promotions

[D]scientific experiments

35.the author’sattitude toward the influence of advertisement on people’s habits is____

[A]indifferent

[B]negative

[C]positive

[D]biased

## Text 4

Many Americans regard the jury system as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values, including the principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on juries; that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community; that no citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race, religion, sex, or national origin; that defendants are entitled to trial by their peers; and that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community and not just the letter of the law. The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than representative democracy. In a direct democracy, citizens take turns governing themselves, rather than electing representatives to govern for them.

But as recently as in 1986, jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals. In some states, for example, jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence, education, and moral character. Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in jury selection as early as the 1880 case of strauder v. West Virginia,the practice of selecting so-called elite or blue-ribbon juries provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws.

The system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid-20th century. Although women first served on state juries in Utah in 1898,it was not until the 1940s that a majority of states made women eligible for jury duty. Even then several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personlly asked to have their names included on the jury list. This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at home, and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the 1960s.

In 1968, the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service Act, ushering in a new era of democratic reforms for the jury.This law abolished special educational requirements for federal jurors and required them to be selected at random from a cross section of the entire community. In the landmark 1975 decision Taylor v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all parts of the community to the state level. The Taylor decision also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to be unconstitutional and ordered states to use the same procedures for selecting male and female jurors.

36.From the principles of theUS jury system,welearn that ______

[A]both litcrate and illiterate people can serve on juries

[B]defendants are immune from trial by their peers

[C]no age limit should be imposed for jury service

[D]judgment should consider the opinion of the public

37.The practice of selecting so-called elite jurors prior to 1968 showed_____

[A]the inadcquavy of antidiscrimination laws

[B]the prevalent discrimination against certain races

[C]the conflicting ideals in jury selection procedures

38.Even in the 1960s,women were seldom on the jury list in some states because_____

[A]they were automatically banned by state laws

[B]they fell far short of the required qualifications

[C]they were supposed to perform domestic duties

[D]they tended to evade public engagement

39.After the Jury Selection and Service Act was passed.___

[A]sex discrimination in jury selection was unconstitutional and had to be abolished

[B]educational requirements became less rigid in the selection of federal jurors

[C]jurors at the state level ought to be representative of the entire community

[D]states ought to conform to the federal court in reforming the jury system

40.in discussing the US jury system,the text centers on_______

[A]its nature and problems

[B]its characteristics and tradition

[C]its problems and their solutions

[D]its tradition and development

“Suatainability” has become apopular word these days, but to Ted Ning, the concept will always have personal meaning. Having endured apainful period of unsustainability in his own life made itclear to him that sustainability-oriented values must be expressed though everyday action and choice.

Ning recalls spending aconfusing year in the late 1990s selling insurance. He’d been though the dot-com boom and burst and,desperate for ajob,signed on with a Boulder agency.

It didin’t go well. “It was a really had move because that’s not my passion,” says Ning, whose dilemma about the job translated, predictably, into a lack of sales. “I was miserable, I had so much anxiety that I would wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the ceiling. I had no money and needed the job. Everyone said, ‘Just wait, you’ll trun the corner, give it some time.’”

## Section 1 Use of English

The Internet affords anonymity to its users, a blessing to privacy and freedom of speech. But that very anonymity is also behind the explosion of cyber-crime that has __1__ across the Web.

1互联网可以让用户匿名登录，这对于保护隐私与言论自由是件好事。2但正是这种匿名上网的方式导致了网络犯罪急剧增加，并使之席卷了整个互联网世界。

Can privacy be preserved __2__ bringing safety and security to a world that seems increasingly __3__?

个世界似乎越来越无法无天，在给这样的世界带来安全保障的同时，隐私是否能得到保护呢?

Last month, Howard Schmidt, the nation’s cyber-czar, offered the federal government a __4__ to make the Web a safer place----a “voluntary trusted identity” system that would be the high-tech __5__ of a physical key, a fingerprint and a photo ID card, all rolled __6__ one. The system might use a smart identity card, or a digital credential __7__ to a specific computer, and would authenticate users at a range of online services.

上个月，全国的互联网沙皇(网络大王)HowardSchmidt给联邦政府提交了一份提案,建议加强网络安全。内容是建立“自愿身份认证”系统，这种高科技技术等同于把有形的钥匙、指纹与带照片的身份证三者融合为一体。2该系统或许采用智能身份卡，也或许会采用与某一具体电脑相连接的数字证件，从而在一系列的在线服务中，证明用户的真实身份。

The idea is to __8__ a federation of private online identity systems. User could __9__ which system to join, and only registered users whose identities have been authenticated could navigate those systems. The approach contrasts with one that would require an Internet driver’s license __10__ by the government.

1该观点的目的是打造一个个人在线身份系统联盟，2用户可以选择加入哪个具体系统，只有身份被核实的注册用户才能操作所有这些系统。3该方式完全不同于要求网络用户具有政府颁发的许可证(这一方式)。

Google and Microsoft are among companies that already have these “single sign-on” systems that make it possible for users to __11__ just once but use many different services.

__12__, the approach would create a “walled garden” in cyberspace, with safe “neighborhoods” and bright “streetlights” to establish a sense of a __13__ community.

事实上，这一方式将在互联网打造出一个“带围墙的花园”，它有着可靠的“邻居”以及明亮的“路灯”，形成了彼此有信任感的社区。

Mr. Schmidt described it as a “voluntary ecosystem” in which “individuals and organizations can complete online transactions with __14__, trusting the identities of each other and the identities of the infrastructure __15__ which the transaction runs”.

Still, the administration’s plan has __16__ privacy rights activists. Some applaud the approach; others are concerned. It seems clear that such a scheme is an initiative push toward what would __17__ be a compulsory Internet “driver’s license” mentality.

1尽管如此，在保护隐私权的激进分子中间，当局的该计划还是引起了分歧。2一些人为之鼓掌叫好，还有些人则为之
担忧。3(不管怎样)很明显，这一计划已经朝着量丝的在互联网强制实施“驾照”的想法迈出了第一步。

The plan has also been greeted with __18__ by some computer security experts, who worry that the “voluntary ecosystem” envisioned by Mr. Schmidt would still leave much of the Internet __19__. They argue that all Internet users should be __20__ to register and identify themselves, in the same way that drivers must be licensed to drive on public roads.

1该计划也受到一些电脑安全专家的怀疑，他们担心Schmidt先生构想出的“自愿生态系统”仍然会让互联网在很大程度上受到攻击。2他们主张所有的互联网用户都必须被强行要求登记身份并加以确认，就像司机必须得到驾照才能上路开车一样。

Ruth Simmons joined Goldman Sachs’s board as an outside director in January, 2000; a year later she became president of Brown University. For the rest of the decade she apparently managed both roles without attracting much criticism. But by the end of 2009, Ms. Simmons was under fire for having sat on Goldman’s compensation committee; how could she have let those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked? By February the next year Ms. Simmons had left the board. The position was just taking up too much time, she said.

1RuthSimmons于2000年1月加入GoldmanSachs公司董事会，成为一名外部董事。一年后她成为布朗大学的校长。2此后近10年时间里，她很明显扮演着两个角色，但并未引起多少责难。3但是在2009年年底，Simmons女士却由于担任Goldman公司薪酬委员会委员受到抨击;她怎么能让那些巨额的奖金支出毫无察觉地就通过了呢?4到第二年的2月份，Simmons便离开Goldman公司董事会5她说，该职位占用了她太多的时间。

Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on a firm’s board. Having made their wealth and their reputations elsewhere, they presumably have enough independence to disagree with the chief executive’s proposals. If the sky, and the share price is falling, outside directors should be able to give advice based on having weathered their own crises.

1外部董事在企业董事会中应扮演有益而又相对公正的(较少偏见的)顾问角色。2由于他们在别处已创造了自己的财富和声畨，所以他们很可能有足够的独立性以否定总裁的建议。3如果公司经营状况不佳，股价下跌，外部董事应该根据自己以往应对危机的经验提出建议。

The researchers from Ohio University used a database that covered more than 10,000 firms and more than 64,000 different directors between 1989 and 2004. Then they simply checked which directors stayed from one proxy statement to the next. The most likely reason for departing a board was age, so the researchers concentrated on those “surprise” disappearances by directorsunder the age of 70. They found that after a surprise departure, the probability that the company will subsequently have to restate earnings increased by nearly 20%. The likelihood of being named in a federal class-action lawsuit also increases, and the stock is likely to perform worse. The effect tended to be larger for larger firms. Although a correlation between them leaving and subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive, it does not mean that such directors are always jumping off a sinking ship. Often they “trade up,” leaving riskier, smaller firms for larger and more stable firms.

1俄亥俄大学的研究者们利用一个数据库(对外部董事)进行了研究，该数据库囊括了1989年至2004年间的10,000多家公司和64,000多位不同的董事。2后来，他们又专门核查了哪些外部董事连任了两届(持续拿到两份委托协议)。3离开董事会最可能的原因是年龄，所以研究者们关注的焦点是那些不到70岁却很“离奇”消失的外部董事们。4他们发现在外部董事意外离职后，其所在公司随后不得不重申盈利状况的可能性上升了近20%。5在联邦法院所受理的集体起诉案件中被涉及的可能性也会增加，并且公司在股市的表现也会更糟。6大公司受到的影响往往会更大。7尽管外部董事的离职与随后企业的糟糕表现两者间的相互关系让人难免揣测，但这并不意味着外部董事们总是

But the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their reputations if they leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows they were on the board at the time any wrongdoing occurred. Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create incentives. Otherwise outside directors will follow the example of Ms. Simmons, once again very popular on campus.

1但是研究人员相信，如果外部董事在坏消息传出前就离开公司，他们会更轻易地避免声誉受损—即使历史记录显示，在该问题出现时，外部董事仍在董事会。2那些想在艰难时期挽留住外部董事的公司一定要采取激励措施。3否则外部董事们就会步Simmons女士的后尘(离职去大学)，再一次在校园受到欢迎。

Whatever happened to the death of newspaper? A year ago the end seemed near. The recession threatened to remove the advertising and readers that had not already fled to the Internet. Newspapers like the San Francisco Chronicle were chronicling their own doom. America’s Federal Trade commission launched a round of talks about how to save newspapers. Should they become charitable corporations? Should the state subsidize them? It will hold another meeting soon. But the discussions now seem out of date.

1针对报业的衰亡究竟发生了些什么?2一年前，末日似乎近在咫尺。3经济衰退危及相关广告的生存，并可能使其失去那些尚未“逃向”互联网的读者们。4诸如《旧金山纪事》这样的报纸都在记录着自己的厄运。5美国联邦贸易委员会曾发起一轮如何拯救报纸的讨论。6他们应该变成公益机构吗?7国家是否应该补贴这些报纸?8近期该委5会还将召开一次会议。9但是现在这些讨论似乎已经不合时宜了。

In much of the world there is little sign of crisis. German and Brazilian papers have shrugged off the recession. Even American newspapers, which inhabit the most troubled corner of the global industry, have not only survived but often returned to profit. Not the 20% profit margins that were routine a few years ago, but profit all the same.

1在世界大多数地区，几乎已经没有危机的迹象。2德国和巴西的报业已经摆脱了衰退。3甚至身处全球报业问题最深渊的美国，也不仅生存了下来，而且还恢复了盈利。4尽管不是前些年惯例20%收益，但毕竟是盈利。

It has not been much fun. Many papers stayed afloat by pushing journalists overboard. The American Society of News Editors reckons that 13,500 newsroom jobs have gone since 2007. Readers are paying more for slimmer products. Some papers even had the nerve to refuse delivery to distant suburbs. Yet these desperate measures have proved the right ones and, sadly for many journalists, they can be pushed further.

1不过当前的情况也不可过于乐观.2许多报纸通过裁员来维持运营。3美国新闻编辑协会估计自2007年以来有13500个编辑(部)岗位被裁减。4报纸内容缩水，但读者却要付费更多。5一些报纸甚至斗胆拒绝向远郊用户投递。6然而事实证明这些孤注一掷的手段是正确的，而对于许多记者来说悲惨的是，他们可能会被继续裁减。

Newspapers are becoming more balanced businesses, with a healthier mix of revenues from readers and advertisers. American papers have long been highly unusual in their reliance on ads. Fully 87% of their revenues came from advertising in 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD). In Japan the proportion is 35%. Not surprisingly, Japanese newspapers are much more stable.

1鉴于来自读者和广告商的收入比日趋合理，报纸正在成为更具平衡性的行业。2长期以来美国报业对广告的过度依赖，都是极不正常的。3根据经济合作与发展组织的数据，报业在2008年高达87%的收入来自广告。4而在日本这个比例只有35%。5难怪，日本的报业更具稳定性。

The whirlwind that swept through newsrooms harmed everybody, but much of the damage has been concentrated in areas where newspapers are least distinctive. Car and film reviewers have gone. So have science and general business reporters. Foreign bureaus have been savagely cut off. Newspapers are less complete as a result. But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper business.

1席卷报业机构的旋风给每一个人都带来了伤害，但是该伤害在很大程度上都集中在毫无报业特色的领域。2汽车和电影评论栏目已不复存在。3科学和大众商业报道栏目也难苋踪影。4驻外机构业已被无情地裁撤。5结果是报纸不再像以往那样完整。6但是完整已不再是报业的一个优点。

We tend to think of the decades immediately following World War II as a time of prosperity and growth, with soldiers returning home by the millions, going off to college on the G. I. Bill and lining up at the marriage bureaus.

我们往往把第二次世界大战后的数十年视作繁荣和发展的时代，数以百万计的士兵回到家乡，靠政府助学金(《退伍军人权利法案》)读大学，或在婚姻登记处排队办理结婚手续。

But when it came to their houses, it was a time of common sense and a belief that less could truly be more. During the Depression and the war, Americans had learned to live with less, and that restraint, in combination with the postwar confidence in the future, made small, efficient housing positively stylish.

1但说到他们的房子问题，在那个时代人们的共识和信仰是:少实际就是多。2在大萧条和战争期间，美国人学会了节衣缩食，这种克制连同战后对未来的信心，使得小而高效的房子成为绝对的时髦。

Economic condition was only a stimulus for the trend toward efficient living. The phrase “less is more” was actually first popularized by a German, the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who like other people associated with the Bauhaus, a school of design, emigrated to the United States before World War II and took up posts at American architecture schools. These designers came to exert enormous influence on the course of American architecture, but none more so than Mies.

1经济状况只是推动高效生活方式这一潮流的一个方面。2“少即是多”这句话实际是由一个LudwigMiesvanderRohe的德国建筑师首先推广开的，像其他与Bauhaus设计学院有关的设计师一样，他于第二次世界大战前移民美国，并曾在美国多个建筑学院任职。3这些设计师对于美国建筑学的发展进程产生了巨大影响，但影响最大的当属Mies。

Mies’s signature phrase means that less decoration, properly organized, has more impact than a lot. Elegance, he believed, did not derive from abundance. Like other modern architects, he employed metal, glass and laminated wood-materials that we take for granted today but that in the 1940s symbolized the future. Mies’s sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces hedesigned were small and efficient, rather than big and often empty.

1Mies的信条是如果布局恰当，装饰的减少反而会更具效果。2他认为，优雅并非源自于数置。3像其他现代建筑师一样，他会使用金属、玻璃和胶合板，这些材料在今天看来是理所当然的选择，但在20世纪40年代却象征着未来。4Mies的精心布局掩盖了一个事实:他所设计的房屋空间是小而高效的，并非大且空旷的。

The apartments in the elegant towers Mies built on Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive, for example, were smaller----two-bedroom units under 1,000 square feet----than those in their older neighbors along the city’s Gold Coast. But they were popular because of their airy glass walls, the views they afforded and the elegance of the buildings’ details and proportions, the architectural equivalent of the abstract art so popular at the time.

1例如，Mies在芝加哥湖岸大道设计建造的那些优雅高楼中的公寓只有两间卧室，面积不到1000平方英尺，比附近那些位于该城市黄金海岸沿线的老建筑都小。2但它们却很抢手，这是因为它们有轻薄的玻璃墙、美丽的景观以及高雅的建筑细节和比例，而这些建筑特点完全等同于当时极受欢迎的抽象艺术。

The trend toward “less” was not entirely foreign. In the 1930s Frank Lloyd Wright started building more modest and efficient houses---usually around 1,200 square feet---than the spreading two-story ones he had designed in the 1890s and the early 20th century.

The “Case Study Houses” commissioned from talented modern architects by California Arts & Architecture magazine between 1945 and 1962 were yet another homegrown influence on the “less is more” trend. Aesthetic effect came from the landscape, new materials and forthright detailing. In his Case Study House, Ralph Rapson may have mispredicted just how mechanical revolution would impact everyday life – few American families acquired helicopters, though most eventually got clothes dryers – but his belief that self-sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable was widely shared.

1《加州艺术与建筑》杂志社在1945到1962年间委托一些才华横溢的现代建筑师们设计了CaseStudyHouses，这是本土设计对“少即是多”趋势的又一个影响。2审美效果源自自然景色、新材料的使用以及明了的细节设计。3在RalphRapson所设计的CaseStudyHouse里，他可能对机械革命给人们曰常生活带来的影响做了错误的预估(因为尽管多数人最终都拥有了烘干机，但拥有直升飞机的家庭却没几个)，但他认为自给自足不仅是理想的而且是在所难免的，这一理念却得到广泛的认同。

Will the European Union make it? The question would have sounded strange not long ago. Now even the project’s greatest cheerleaders talk of a continent facing a “Bermuda triangle” of debt, population decline and lower growth.

1欧盟会成功吗?2若在不久之前提出此问题，会让人很奇怪。3但现在即使是该工程(欧盟计划)最有力的支持者们也都在谈论整个大陆所面临的“百慕大三角”一•债务、人口下降以及增长的减缓。

As well as those chronic problems, the EU faces an acute crisis in its economic core, the 16 countries that use the single currency. Markets have lost faith that the euro zone’s economies, weaker or stronger, will one day converge thanks to the discipline of sharing a single currency, which denies uncompetitive members the quick fix of devaluation.

1除了上述长期性问题，欧盟还在其核心经济体，即使用统一货币的那16个国家，面临着一个严重的危机。2欧元区的经济体，无论强弱，都会由于共用一种单一货币的约束—这让缺乏竞争力的成员国无法采取货币贬值这一应急措施—而走向联合，对此观点，市场已然丧失信心。

Yet the debate about how to save Europe’s single currency from disintegration is stuck. It is stuck because the euro zone’s dominant powers, France and Germany, agree on the need for greater harmonization within the euro zone, but disagree about what to harmonies.

1然而，有关如何保护欧盟统一货币免遭崩溃的讨论陷入了偃局。2之所以陷入倀局，是由于作为欧元区主导国家的法国和德国虽然都承认有必要在欧元区进行更多协调，但在协调内容上却有分歧。

Germany thinks the euro must be saved by stricter rules on borrowing, spending and competitiveness, backed by quasi-automatic sanctions for governments that do not obey. These might include threats to freeze EU funds for poorer regions and EU mega-projects and even the suspension of a country’s voting rights in EU ministerial councils. It insists that economic co-ordination should involve all 27 members of the EU club, among whom there is a small majority for free-market liberalism and economic rigour; in the inner core alone, Germany fears, a small majority favour French interference.

1德国认为必须通过对借贷、开支和争实行更严格的规范才能拯救欧元，并且要通过对那些不守规矩的政府进行半自动制裁来强化这些规范的效力。2制裁或许包括威胁冻结欧盟对贫困地区提供的以及欧盟大型项目的资金，甚至暂停一个国家在欧盟部长会议上的投票权。3德国认为经济协调应包括欧盟俱乐部的全体27个成员;在这些成员中，认同自由市场主义和经济严酷性的占微弱多数。而单就核心成员来讲，德国担心赞同法国干预的会占微弱多数

A “southern” camp headed by French wants something different: “European economic government” within an inner core of euro-zone members. Translated, that means politicians intervening in monetary policy and a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members, via cheaper borrowing for governments through common Eurobonds or complete fiscal transfers. Finally, figures close to the France government have murmured, euro-zone members should agree to some fiscal and social harmonization: e.g., curbing competition in corporate-tax rates or labour costs.

1由法国领导的“南部”阵营有着不同的打算:在欧元区成员国这一内部核心成立一个“欧洲经济政府”。2换句话说，就是政治家可对货币政策以及富国到穷国的再分配体制进行干预，其方式是通过共同的欧元债券或完全的财政转移对成员国政府提供低息借贷。3最终，那些接近法国政府的人士私下抱怨说，欧元区成员国应该就财政和社会的协调达成共识，例如，抑制公司税率或劳动力成本两方面的竞争。

It is too soon to write off the EU. It remains the world’s largest trading block. At its best, the European project is remarkably liberal: built around a single market of 27 rich and poor countries, its internal borders are far more open to goods, capital and labour than any comparable trading area. It is an ambitious attempt to blunt the sharpest edges of globalization, and make capitalism benign.

1认为欧盟已破产还为时过早。2它仍是世界最大的贸易区。3从其好的方面来讲，欧盟工程相当自由:由于建立的基
础是27个贫富不一的国家所组成的统一市场，其内部边界对商品、资本以及劳动力的流通比任何其他类似贸易区都更加开放。4欧盟一体化工程是一次宏大的尝试，其目的是缓和全球化的冲击，让资本主义更温和有利。

Leading doctors today weigh in on the debate over the government’s role in promoting public health by demanding that ministers impose “fat faxes” on unhealthy food and introduce cigarette-style warnings to children about the dangers of a poor diet.

一些极有影响力的医生现在也加入到了有关政府在促进公众健康方面应扮演角色的辩论中，他们要求政府部长们对不健康食品征收“脂肪税”，并借用警告烟草的方式来警告孩子们不良饮食的种种危险。

The demands follow comments made last week by the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, who insisted the government could not force people to make healthy choices and promised to free businesses from public health regulations.

这些要求是在卫生部长AndrewLansley上周发表评论之后提出的，AndrewLansley认为政府不能强迫人们做出健康上的选择，并承诺不会让企业受到公共卫生规定的约束。

But senior medical figures want to stop fast-food outlets opening near schools, restrict advertising of products high in fat, salt or sugar, and limit sponsorship of sports events by fast-food producers such as McDonald’s.

但是，资深医学专家想阻止快餐店在学校附近开业，限制高脂肪、高盐分和高含糖量产品的广告宣传，他们还想限制像麦当劳这样的快餐生产商对体育项目的赞助。

They argue that government action is necessary to curb Britain’s addiction to unhealthy food and help halt spiraling rates to obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Professor Terence Stephenson, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health，said that the consumption of unhealthy food should be seen to be just as damaging as smoking or excessive drinking.

1他们认为政府有必要采取行动以抵制英国人对不健康食品的嗜好，并帮助终结肥胖症、糖尿病和心脏病发病率的剧增。2皇家儿科与儿童健康学院院长TerenceStephenson教授说:不健康食品的食用应该被视作是与吸烟或酗酒同样具有危害的行为。

“Thirty years ago, it would have been inconceivable to have imagined a ban on smoking in the work-place or in pubs, and yet that is what we have now. Are we willing to be just as courageous in respect of obesity? 1 would suggest that we should be,” said the leader of the UK’s children’s doctors.

1英国儿科医生负责人说:“三十年前，人们很难想象在工作场所或酒吧禁止吸烟，但是现在已成现实。2在肥胖问题上我们能做到同样果敢吗?3我认为我们应该有同样的勇气。”

Lansley has alarmed health campaigners by suggesting he wants industry rather than government to take the lead. He said that manufacturers of crisps and candies could play a central role in the Change4Life campaign, the centrepiece of government efforts to boost healthy eating and fitness. He has also criticised the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver’s high-profile attempt to improve school lunches in England as an example of how “lecturing” people was not the best way to change their behaviour.

1Lansley表示他想让企业而不是政府率先行动，这让健康运动推行者感到很不安。2他说薯片和糖果生产商们能在“为生命而改变”的运动中起到核心作用，而该运动是政府努力推动饮食与健康的中心内容。3他还批评了名厨JamieOliver的高调行为(Oliver试图改善英国学校午餐质量)，并把后者的努力视作是一个案例，以证明对人们“说教”并非是改变人们行为的最好方式。

Stephenson suggested potential restrictions could include banning TV advertisements for foods high in fat, salt or sugar before 9 pm and limiting them on billboards or in cinemas. “If we were really bold, we might even begin to think of high-calorie fast food in the same way as cigarettes-by setting strict limits on advertising, product placement and sponsorship of sports events,” he said.

1Stephenson表示可能的潜在限制包括以下内容:晚九点前禁止播放高脂肪、高盐分和高糖量食品的电视广告并限制该类食品上广告牌或进电影院。2他说:“如果我们真正勇敢，我们甚至可以开始把高热置的食品与烟草一样对待—对其广告、产品摆放和体育比赛的赞助施加严格限制。”

Such a move could affect firms such as McDonald’s, which sponsors the youth coaching scheme run by Football Association. Fast-food chains should also stop offering “inducements” such as toys, cute animals and mobile phone credit to lure young customer, Stephenson said.

1这样的行动可能会影响像麦当劳这样的公司，麦当劳一直在赞助足协所运作的年轻球员训练项目。2Stephenson认为快餐连锁店也应该停止提供玩具、可爱的小动物、手机话费等“诱饵”来引诱年轻顾客。

Professor Dinesh Bhugra, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “If children are taught about the impact that food has on their growth, and that some things can harm, at least information is available up front.”

皇家精神病学院院长DineshBhugra教授说:“如果教导孩子注意食品对成长的影响，并告知孩子有些食品是有害的，至少他们可以先获悉这些信息。”

He also urged councils to impose “fast-food-free zones” around schools and hospitals——areas within which takeaways cannot open.

他还强烈要求市政会在学校和医院周围强制划出“快餐禁区”，在这些区域不得经营外卖餐馆。

A Department of Health spokesperson said:“We need to create a new vision for public health where all of society works together to get healthy and live longer. This includes creating a new ‘responsibility deal’ with business, built on social responsibility, not state regulation. Later this year, we will publish a white paper setting out exactly how we will achieve this. ”

1一位卫生部发言人说:“我们需要营造一种新的公众健康观念，全社会齐心协力造就健康，延长寿命。2这包括和商界达成新的‘责任协议’，该协议应基于社会责任而不是政府的规定。3今年晚些时候，我们将发布一份白皮书，以精确阐述我们实现该愿景的措施。”

The food industry will be alarmed that such senior doctors back such radical moves, especially the call to use some of the tough tactics that have been deployed against smoking over the last decade.

资深医生对这些激进运动的支持，尤其是号召使用过去十年用于禁烟的强硬措施，使得食品行业深为不安。

Who would have thought that, globally, the IT industry produces about the same volume of greenhouse gases as the world’s airlines do---rough 2 percent of all CO2 emissions?

Many everyday tasks take a surprising toll on the environment. A Google search can leak between 0.2 and 7.0 grams of CO2, depending on how many attempts are needed to get the “right” answer. To deliver results to its users quickly, then, Google has to maintain vast data centres around the world, packed with powerful computers. While producing large quantities of CO2, these computers emit a great deal of heat, so the centres need to be well air-conditioned, which uses even more energy.

However, Google and other big tech providers monitor their efficiency closely and make improvements. Monitoring is the first step on the road to reduction, but there is much to be done, and not just by big companies.

Homework has never been terribly popular with students and even many parents, but in recent years it has been particularly scorned. School districts across the country, most recently Los Angeles Unified, are revising their thinking on his educational ritual. Unfortunately, L. A. Unified has produced an inflexible policy which mandates that with the exception of some advancedcourses, homework may no longer count for more than 10% of a student’s academic grade.

This rule is meant to address the difficulty that students from impoverished or chaotic homes might have in completing their homework. But the policy is unclear and contradictory. Certainly, no homework should be assigned that students cannot complete on their own or that they cannot do without expensive equipment. But if the district is essentially giving a pass to students who do not do their homework because of complicated family lives, it is going riskily close to the implication that standards need to be lowered for poor children.

District administrators say that homework will still be a part of schooling: teachers are allowed to assign as much of it as they want. But with homework counting for no more than 10% of their grades, students can easily skip half their homework and see very little difference on their report cards. Some students might do well on state tests without completing their homework, but what about the students who performed well on the tests and did their homework? It is quite possible that the homework helped. Yet rather than empowering teachers to find what works best for their students, the policy imposes a flat, across-the-board rule.

At the same time, the policy addresses none of the truly thorny questions about homework. Ifthe district finds homework to be unimportant to its students’ academic achievement, it should move to reduce or eliminate the assignments, not make them count for almost nothing. Conversely, if homework matters, it should account for a significant portion of the grade. Meanwhile, this policy does nothing to ensure that the homework students receive is meaningful or appropriate to their age and the subject, or that teachers are not assigning more than they are willing to review and correct.

The homework rules should be put on hold while the school board, which is responsible for setting educational policy, looks into the matter and conducts public hearings. It is not too late for L. A. Unified to do homework right.

\21. It is implied in paragraph 1 that nowadays homework_____. 

- [A] is receiving more criticism
  [B]is no longer an educational ritual
  [C]is not required for advanced courses
- [D]is gaining more preferences

\22. L. A. Unified has made the rule about homework mainly because poor students_____.

- [A] tend to have moderate expectations for their education
  [B] have asked for a different educational standard
  [C] may have problems finishing their homework
- [D] have voiced their complaints about homework

\23. According to Paragraph 3, one problem with the policy is that it may. 

- [A]discourage students from doing homework
  [B]result in students' indifference to their report cards
  [C]undermine the authority of state tests
- [D]restrict teachers' power in education

\24. As mentioned in Paragraph 4, a key question unanswered about homework is whether______.

- [A] it should be eliminated
- [B]it counts much in schooling
- [C]it places extra burdens on teachers
- [D]it is important for grades

Pretty in pink: adult women do not remember being so obsessed with the colour, yet it is pervasive in our young girls’ lives. It is not that pink is intrinsically bad, but it is such a tiny slice of the rainbow and, though it may celebrate girlhood in one way, it also repeatedly and firmlyfuses girls’ identity to appearance. Then it presents that connection, even among two-year-olds, between girls as not only innocent but as evidence of innocence. Looking around, I despaired atthe singular lack of imagination about girls’ lives and interests.

Girls’ attraction to pink may seem unavoidable, somehow encoded in their DNA, butaccording to Jo Paoletti, an associate professor of American Studies, it is not. Children were not colour-coded at all until the early 20th century: in the era before domestic washing machines all babies wore white as a practical matter, since the only way of getting clothes clean was to boilthem. What’s more, both boys and girls wore what were thought of as gender-neutral dresses.

When nursery colours were introduced, pink was actually considered the more masculine colour, a pastel version of red, which was associated with strength. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin Mary, constancy and faithfulness, symbolised femininity. It was not until the mid-1980s, whenamplifying age and sex differences became a dominant children’s marketing strategy, that pinkfully came into its own, when it began to seem inherently attractive to girls, part of what defined them as female, at least for the first few critical years.

I had not realised how profoundly marketing trends dictated our perception of what is natural to kids, including our core beliefs about their psychological development. Take the toddler. Iassumed that phase was something experts developed after years of research into children’sbehaviour: wrong. Turns out, according to Daniel Cook, a historian of childhood consumerism, it was popularized as a marketing trick by clothing manufacturers in the 1930s.

Trade publications counselled department stores that, in order to increase sales, they shouldcreate a “third stepping stone” between infant wear and older kids’ clothes. It was only after“toddler” became a common shoppers’ term that it evolved into a broadly accepted developmental stage. Splitting kids, or adults, into ever-tinier categories has proved a sure-fire way to boost profits. And one of the easiest ways to segment a market is to magnify gender differences – or invent them where they did not previously exist.

\26. By saying "it is...the rainbow"(Line 3, Para.1),the author means pink______. 

- [A]should not be the sole representation of girlhood
  [B]should not be associated with girls' innocence
  [C]cannot explain girls' lack of imagination
- [D]cannot influence girls' lives and interests

\27. According to Paragraph 2, which of the following is true of colours? 

- [A] Colours are encoded in girls' DNA.
  [B]Blue used to be regarded as the colour for girls.
  [C]Pink used to be a neutral colour in symbolising genders.
- [D]White is preferred by babies.

\28. The author suggests that our perception of children's psychological development was much influenced by_____.

- [A]the marketing of products for children
  [B]the observation of children's nature
- [C]researches into children's behavior
-  [D]studies of childhood consumption

\29. We may learn from Paragraph 4 that department stores were advised to_____.

- [A]focus on infant wear and older kids' clothes
  [B]attach equal importance to different genders
  [C]classify consumers into smaller groups
- [D]create some common shoppers' terms

\30. It can be concluded that girls' attraction to pink seems to be. 

- [A] clearly explained by their inborn tendency
  [B]fully understood by clothing manufacturers
  [C] mainly imposed by profit-driven businessmen
- [D]well interpreted by psychological experts

In 2010, a federal judge shook America's biotech industry to its core. Companies had won patents for isolated DNA for decades-by 2005 some 20% of human genes were patented. But in March 2010 a judge ruled that genes were unpatentable. Executives were violently agitated. The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), a trade group, assured members that this was just a“preliminary step” in a longer battle.

On July 29th they were relieved, at least temporarily. A federal appeals court overturned the prior decision, ruling that Myriad Genetics could indeed hold patents to two genes that help forecast a woman's risk of breast cancer. The chief executive of Myriad, a company in Utah, said the ruling was a blessing to firms and patients alike.

But as companies continue their attempts at personalized medicine, the courts will remain rather busy. The Myriad case itself is probably not over. Critics make three main arguments against gene patents: a gene is a product of nature, so it may not be patented; gene patents suppress innovation rather than reward it; and patents' monopolies restrict access to genetic tests such as Myriad's. A growing number seem to agree. Last year a federal task-force urged reform for patents related to genetic tests. In October the Department of Justice filed a brief in the Myriad case, arguing that an isolated DNA molecule “is no less a product of nature...than are cotton fibers that have been separated from cotton seeds.”

Despite the appeals court's decision, big questions remain unanswered. For example, it is unclear whether the sequencing of a whole genome violates the patents of individual genes within it. The case may yet reach the Supreme Court.

AS the industry advances, however, other suits may have an even greater impact. Companies are unlikely to file many more patents for human DNA molecules-most are already patented or in the public domain. Firms are now studying how genes interact, looking for correlations that mightbe used to determine the causes of disease or predict a drug’s efficacy, companies are eager to winpatents for ‘connecting the dots’, explains Hans Sauer, a lawyer for the BIO.

Their success may be determined by a suit related to this issue, brought by the Mayo Clinic, which the Supreme Court will hear in its next term. The BIO recently held a convention which included sessions to coach lawyers on the shifting landscape for patents. Each meeting was packed.

\31. It can be learned from paragraph I that the biotech companies would like _____. 

- A. their executives to be active
  B. judges to rule out gene patenting
  C. genes to be patentable
- D. the BIO to issue a warning

\32. Those who are against gene patents believe that _____. 

- A. genetic tests are not reliable
  B. only man-made products are patentable
  C. patents on genes depend much on innovation
- D. courts should restrict access to genetic tests

\33. According to Hans Sauer, companies are eager to win patents for _____. 

- A. establishing disease correlations
  B. discovering gene interactions
  C. drawing pictures of genes
- D. identifying human DNA

\34. By saying “each meeting was packed” (Line 4, Para. 6), the author means that _____. 

- A. the Supreme Court was authoritative
  B. the BIO was a powerful organization
  C. gene patenting was a great concern
- D. lawyers were keen to attend conventions

\35. Generally speaking, the author’s attitude toward gene patenting is _____. 

- A. critical
  B. supportive
  C. scornful
- D. objective

## Text 4

The great recession may be over, but this era of high joblessness is probably beginning. Before it ends, it will likely change the life course and character of a generation of young adults. And ultimately, it is likely to reshape our politics, our culture, and the character of our society for years.

No one tries harder than the jobless to find silver linings in this national economic disaster. Many said that unemployment, while extremely painful, had improved them in some ways; they had become less materialistic and more financially prudent; they were more aware of the struggles of others. In limited respects, perhaps the recession will leave society better off. At the very least, it has awoken us from our national fever dream of easy riches and bigger houses, and put a necessary end to an era of reckless personal spending.

But for the most part, these benefits seem thin, uncertain, and far off. In The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth, the economic historian Benjamin Friedman argues that both inside and outside the U.S., lengthy periods of economic stagnation or decline have almost always left society more mean-spirited and less inclusive, and have usually stopped or reversed the advance of rights and freedoms. Anti-immigrant sentiment typically increases, as does conflict between races and classes.

Income inequality usually falls during a recession, but it has not shrunk in this one. Indeed, this period of economic weakness may reinforce class divides, and decrease opportunities to cross them--- especially for young people. The research of Till Von Wachter, the economist in Columbia University, suggests that not all people graduating into a recession see their life chances dimmed: those with degrees from elite universities catch up fairly quickly to where they otherwise would have been if they had graduated in better times; it is the masses beneath them that are left behind.

In the Internet age, it is particularly easy to see the resentment that has always been hidden within American society. More difficult, in the moment, is discerning precisely how these leantimes are affecting society’s character. In many respects, the U.S. was more socially tolerant entering this recession than at any time in its history, and a variety of national polls on social conflict since then have shown mixed results. We will have to wait and see exactly how these hard times will reshape our social fabric. But they certainly will shape it, and all the more so the longer they extend.

\36. By saying “to find silver linings” (Line 1, Para.2) the author suggest that the jobless try to___. 

- [A]seek subsidies from the government
  [B]explore reasons for the unemployment
  [C]make profits from the troubled economy
- [D]look on the bright side of the recession

\37. According to Paragraph 2, the recession has made people_____. 

- [A]realize the national dream
  [B]struggle against each other
  [C]challenge their prudence
- [D]reconsider their lifestyle

\38. Benjamin Friedman believe that economic recessions may_____. 

- [A]impose a heavier burden on immigrants
  [B]bring out more evils of human nature
  [C]promote the advance of rights and freedoms
- [D]ease conflicts between races and classes

\39. The research of Till Von Wachther suggests that in recession graduates from elite universities tend to _____.

- [A]lag behind the others due to decreased opportunities
  [B]catch up quickly with experienced employees
- [C]see their life chances as dimmed as the others’
- [D]recover more quickly than the others

\40. The author thinks that the influence of hard times on society is.

- [A]certain
  [B]positive
  [C]trivial
- [D]destructive

“Universal history, the history of what man has accomplished in this world, is at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here,” wrote the Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle. Well, not any more it is not.

Suddenly, Britain looks to have fallen out with its favourite historical form. This could be no more than a passing literary craze, but it also points to a broader truth about how we now approach the past: less concerned with learning from forefathers and more interested in feeling their pain. Today, we want empathy, not inspiration.

From the earliest days of the Renaissance, the writing of history meant recounting the exemplary lives of great men. In 1337, Petrarch began work on his rambling writing De Viris Illustribus – On Famous Men, highlighting the virtus (or virtue) of classical heroes. Petrarch celebrated their greatness in conquering fortune and rising to the top. This was the biographical tradition which Niccolo Machiavelli turned on its head. In The Prince, he championed cunning, ruthlessness, and boldness, rather than virtue, mercy and justice, as the skills of successful leaders.

Over time, the attributes of greatness shifted. The Romantics commemorated the leading painters and authors of their day, stressing the uniqueness of the artist's personal experience rather than public glory. By contrast, the Victorian author Samual Smiles wrote Self-Help as a catalogue of the worthy lives of engineers, industrialists and explores. "The valuable examples which they furnish of the power of self-help, of patient purpose, resolute working and steadfast integrity, issuing in the formation of truly noble and manly character, exhibit," wrote Smiles, "what it is in the power of each to accomplish for himself." His biographies of James Walt, Richard Arkwright and Josiah Wedgwood were held up as beacons to guide the working man through his difficult life.

This was all a bit bourgeois for Thomas Carlyle, who focused his biographies on the truly heroic lives of Martin Luther, Oliver Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte. These epochal figures represented lives hard to imitate, but to be acknowledged as possessing higher authority than mere mortals.

Not everyone was convinced by such bombast. “The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles,” wrote Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto. For them, history did nothing, it possessed no immense wealth nor waged battles: “It is man, real, living manwho does all that.” And history should be the story of the masses and their record of struggle. Assuch, it needed to appreciate the economic realities, the social contexts and power relations in which each epoch stood. For: “Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstancesdirectly found, given and transmitted from the past.”

This was the tradition which revolutionized our appreciation of the past. In place of Thomas Carlyle, Britain nurtured Christopher Hill, EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. History from below stood alongside biographies of great men. Whole new realms of understanding — from gender to race to cultural studies — were opened up as scholars unpicked the multiplicity of lost societies. And it transformed public history too: downstairs became just as fascinating as upstairs.

When people in developing countries worry about migration, they are usually concerned at the prospect of their best and brightest departure to Silicon Valley or to hospitals and universities in the developed world. These are the kind of workers that countries like Britain, Canada and Australia try to attract by using immigration rules that privilege college graduates. 

Lots of studies have found that well-educated people from developing countries are particularly likely to emigrate. A big survey of Indian households in 2004 found that nearly 40% of emigrants had more than a high-school education, compared with around 3.3% of all Indians over the age of 25. This "brain drain" has long bothered policymakers in poor countries. They fear that it hurts their economies, depriving them of much-needed skilled workers who could have taught at their universities, worked in their hospitals and come up with clever new products for their factories to make.

In an essay entitled “Making It in America,”, the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from cotton country about just how much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average millhas only two employees today, “a man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog, and the dog isthere to keep the man away from the machines.”

Davidson’s article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the pointthat the reason we have such stubbornly high unemployment and declining middle-class incomes today is largely because of the big drop in demand because of the Great Recession, but it is also because of the advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution, which are more rapidly than ever replacing labor with machines or foreign workers.

In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job, could earn an average lifestyle.But, today, average is officially over. Being average just won’t earn you what it used to. It can’twhen so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, everyone needs to find their extra — their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment.

Yes, new technology has been eating jobs forever, and always will. But there’s been an acceleration. As Davidson notes, “In the 10 years ending in 2009, U.S. factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs — about 6 million in total — disappeared.”

There will always be change — new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing we know for sure is that with each advance in globalization and the I.T. revolution, the best jobs will require workers to have more and better education to make themselves above average.

In a world where average is officially over, there are many things we need to do to support employment, but nothing would be more important than passing some kind of G. I. Bill for the 21st century that ensures that every American has access to post-high school education.

\21. The joke in Paragraph 1 is used to illustrate_______. [A] the impact of technological advances

A century ago, the immigrants from across the Atlantic included settlers and sojourners. Along with the many folks looking to make a permanent home in the United States came those who had no intention to stay, and 7 million people arrived while about 2 million departed. About a quarter of all Italian immigrants, for example, eventually returned to Italy for good. They even had an affectionate nickname, "uccelli di passaggio," birds of passage.

Today, we are much more rigid about immigrants. We divide newcomers into two categories: legal or illegal, good or bad. We hail them as Americans in the making, or our broken immigration system and the long political paralysis over how to fix it. We don't need more categories, but we need to change the way we think about categories. We need to look beyond strict definitions of legal and illegal. To start, we can recognize the new birds of passage, those living and thriving in the gray areas. We might then begin to solve our immigration challenges.

Crop pickers, violinists, construction workers, entrepreneurs, engineers, home health-care aides and physicists are among today's birds of passage. They are energetic participants in a global economy driven by the flow of work, money and ideas. They prefer to come and go as opportunity calls them. They can manage to have a job in one place and a family in another.

With or without permission, they straddle laws, jurisdictions and identities with ease. We need them to imagine the United States as a place where they can be productive for a while without committing themselves to staying forever. We need them to feel that home can be both here and there and that they can belong to two nations honorably.

Accommodating this new world of people in motion will require new attitudes on both sides of the immigration battle. Looking beyond the culture war logic of right or wrong means opening up the middle ground and understanding that managing immigration today requires multiple paths and multiple outcomes. Including some that are not easy to accomplish legally in the existing system.

\26. “Birds of passage” refers to those who____. [A] immigrate across the Atlantic
[B] leave their home countries for good
[C] stay in a foreign temporarily

[D]find permanent jobs overseas

\27. It is implied in paragraph 2 that the current immigration system in the US____. [A] needs new immigrant categories
[B] has loosened control over immigrants
[C] should be adopted to meet challenges

[D]has been fixed via political means

\28. According to the author, today’s birds of passage want___. [A] financial incentives
[B] a global recognition
[C] opportunities to get regular jobs

[D]the freedom to stay and leave

\29. The author suggests that the birds of passage today should be treated __. [A] as faithful partners
[B] with economic favors
[C] with legal tolerance

[D]as mighty rivals

30 which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the text? [A] Come and Go: Big Mistake
[B] Living and Thriving: Great Risk
[C] With or Without: Great Risk

[D]Legal or Illegal: Big Mistake

Scientists have found that although we are prone to snap overreactions, if we take a moment and think about how we are likely to react, we can reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of our quick, hard-wired responses.

Snap decisions can be important defense mechanisms; if we are judging whether someone is dangerous, our brains and bodies are hard-wired to react very quickly, within milliseconds. But we need more time to assess other factors. To accurately tell whether someone is sociable, studies show, we need at least a minute, preferably five. It takes a while to judge complex aspects of perso nality, like neuroticism or open-mindedness.

But snap decisions in reaction to rapid stimuli aren’t exclusive to the interpersonal realm.Psychologists at the University of Toronto found that viewing a fast-food logo for just a few milliseconds primes us to read 20 percent faster, even though reading has little to do with eating. We unconsciously associate fast food with speed and impatience and carry those impulses intowhatever else we’re doing. Subjects exposed to fast-food flashes also tend to think a musical piece lasts too long.

Yet we can reverse such influences. If we know we will overreact to consumer products or housing options when we see a happy face (one reason good sales representatives and real estate agents are always smiling), we can take a moment before buying. If we know female job screeners are more likely to reject attractive female applicants, we can help screeners understand their biases— or hire outside screeners.

John Gottman, the marriage expert, explains that we quickly “thin slice” information reliably only after we ground such snap reactions in “thick sliced” long-term study. When Dr. Gottman really wants to assess whether a couple will stay together, he invites them to his island retreat for a much longer evaluation: two days, not two seconds.

Our ability to mute our hard-wired reactions by pausing is what differentiates us from animals: dogs can think about the future only intermittently or for a few minutes. But historically we have spent about 12 percent of our days contemplating the longer term. Although technologymight change the way we react, it hasn’t changed our nature. We still have the imaginativecapacity to rise above temptation and reverse the high-speed trend.

\31. The time needed in making decisions may____. [A] vary according to the urgency of the situation [B] prove the complexity of our brain reaction
[C] depend on the importance of the assessment [D] predetermine the accuracy of our judgment

\32. Our reaction to a fast-food logo shows that snap decisions____. [A] can be associative
[B] are not unconscious
[C] can be dangerous

[D] are not impulsive

\33. To reverse the negative influences of snap decisions, we should____. [A] trust our first impression
[B] do as people usually do
[C] think before we act

[D] ask for expert advice

\34. John Gottman says that reliable snap reactions are based on____.

[A] critical assessment [B] ‘‘thin sliced’’ study [C] sensible explanation [D] adequate information

\35. The author’s attitude toward reversing the high-speed trend is____. [A] tolerant
[B] uncertain
[C] optimistic

[D] doubtful

Europe is not a gender-equality heaven. In particular, the corporate workplace will never be completely family—friendly until women are part of senior management decisions, and Europe’s top corporate-governance positions remain overwhelmingly male. Indeed, women hold only 14 percent of positions on Europe corporate boards.

The Europe Union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women—up to 60 percent. This proposed mandate was born of frustration. Last year, Europe Commission Vice President Viviane Reding issued a call to voluntary action. Reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goal of 40 percent female board membership. But her appeal was considered a failure: only 24 companies took it up.

Do we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate Ladder fairy as they balance work and family?

“Personally, I don’t like quotas,” Reding said recently. “But I like what the quotas do.” Quotas get action: they “open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling,”according to Reding, a result seen in France and other countries with legally binding provisions on placing women in top business positions.

I understand Reding’s reluctance and her frustration. I don’t like quotas either; they runcounter to my belief in meritocracy, government by the capable. But, when one considers the obstacles to achieving the meritocratic ideal, it does look as if a fairer world must be temporarily ordered.

After all, four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as the US are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top position— no matter how much“soft pressure” is put upon them. When women do break through to the summit of corporatepower--as, for example, Sheryl Sandberg recently did at Facebook—they attract massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule.

If appropriate pubic policies were in place to help all women---whether CEOs or theirchildren’s caregivers--and all families, Sandberg would be no more newsworthy than any other highly capable person living in a more just society.

\36. In the European corporate workplace, generally_____. [A] women take the lead
[B] men have the final say
[C] corporate governance is overwhelmed

[D] senior management is family-friendly



\37. The European Union’s intended legislation is ________.[A] a reflection of gender balance

The hugely popular blog the Skint Foodie chronicles how Tony balances his love of good food with living on benefits. After bills, Tony has £60 a week to spend, £40 of which goes on food, but 10 years ago he was earning £130,000 a year working in corporate communications and eating at London's best restaurants at least twice a week. Then his marriage failed, his career burned out and his drinking became serious. "The community mental health team saved my life. And I felt like that again, to a certain degree, when people responded to the blog so well. It gave me the validation and confidence that I'd lost. But it's still a day-by-day thing." Now he's living in a council flat and fielding offers from literary agents. He's feeling positive, but he'll carry on blogging - not about eating as cheaply as you can - "there are so many people in a much worse state, with barely any money to spend on food" - but eating well on a budget. Here's his advice for economical foodies.

41._____________________

Impulsive spending isn't an option, so plan your week's menu in advance, making shopping lists for your ingredients in their exact quantities. I have an Excel template for a week of breakfast, lunch and dinner. Stop laughing: it's not just cost effective but helps you balance your diet. It's also a good idea to shop daily instead of weekly, because, being human, you'll sometimes change your mind about what you fancy.

42________________________

This is where supermarkets and their anonymity come in handy. With them, there's not the same embarrassment as when buying one carrot in a little greengrocer. And if you plan properly, you'll know that you only need, say, 350g of shin of beef and six rashers of bacon, not whatever weight is pre-packed in the supermarket chiller.

43____________________________

You may proudly claim to only have frozen peas in the freezer - that's not good enough. Mine is filled with leftovers, bread, stock, meat and fish. Planning ahead should eliminate wastage, but if you have surplus vegetables you'll do a vegetable soup, and all fruits threatening to “go off” will be cooked or juiced.

44_______________________

Everyone says this, but it really is a top tip for frugal eaters. Shop at butchers, delis and fish-sellers regularly, even for small things, and be super friendly. Soon you'll feel comfortable asking if they've any knuckles of ham for soups and stews, or beef bones, chicken carcasses and fish heads for stock which, more often than not, they’ll let you have for free.

45______________________

You won't be eating out a lot, but save your pennies and once every few months treat yourself to a set lunch at a good restaurant —£1.75 a week for three months gives you £21 - more than enough for a three-course lunch at Michelin-starred Arbutus. It's £16.95 there - or £12.99 for a large pizza from Domino's: I know which I'd rather eat.

I can pick a date from the past 53 years and know instantly where I was, what happened in the news and even the day of the week. I’ve been able to do this since I was 4.

I never feel overwhelmed with the amount of information my brain absorbs. My mind seems to be able to cope and the information is stored away neatly. When I think of a sad memory, I do what everybody does – try to put it to one side. I don't think it's harder for me just because my memory is clearer. Powerful memory doesn't make my emotions any more acute or vivid. I can recall the day my grandfather died and the sadness I felt when we went to the hospital the day before. I also remember that the musical play Hair opened on Broadway on the same day – they both just pop into my mind in the same way.
